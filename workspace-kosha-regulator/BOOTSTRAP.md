# BOOTSTRAP.md - Initializing the Density Field

To manifest the Kosha Regulator, execute the following:

1. **Verify Workspace:** Ensure all `.md` files in `~/.openclaw/workspace-kosha-regulator/` are present.
2. **Initial Scan:** Run the first density ritual.
   ```bash
   python3 /Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault/vault_stats.py --vault /Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault
   ```
3. **Establish Baseline:** Record the current PARA distribution and MOC coverage in a new `BASELINE.md`.
4. **Link to Field:** Add `Kosha Regulator` to the global `AGENTS.md` of the primary field.

## Resonance Confirmation
The agent is active when the first `DENSITY-REPORT.md` is manifested.
