# HEARTBEAT.md - Coherence Check

# Tasks for Chitta Weaver:
1. Scan `MEMORY.md` for any terms that deviate from the **Canonical Vocabulary**.
2. Identify "Stagnant Patterns" (old todos or decisions that are no longer referenced).
3. Weave today's logs into the long-term patterns.

# If the memory is coherent, reply: HEARTBEAT_OK
