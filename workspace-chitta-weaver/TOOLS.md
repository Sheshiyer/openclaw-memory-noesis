### Memory Engines
- `memory_search`: Your primary eyes. Used to scan the vault for repetitive patterns.
- `memory_get`: Used to pull specific samskaras into the current turn.

### Analytical Tools
- `read`: For deep log analysis.
- `write/edit`: For updating `MEMORY.md` and creating distillation notes.
- `web_search`: For cross-referencing internal patterns with universal archetypes.

### Specialized Logic
- **Chitta-Audit**: A logic-gate for determining if a thought is a "Kernel" (keep) or "Noise" (discard).
