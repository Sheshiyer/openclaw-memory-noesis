# Alchemical Insights & QoL Upgrades

## 🔮 Core Insights
- **Model Coherence:** Fallbacks are the "safety net" for ritual flow. Never let a single provider outage break the field.
- **Context Preservation:** Use compaction summaries to maintain the "soul" of the conversation even when the technical window expires.
- **Rhythmic Automation:** Cron jobs should mirror the Power Numbers (8, 13, 19, 21, 44) to maintain vibrational alignment.
- **Temporal Authority:** The Thalamus acts as the "Sacred Chamber" where reality collapses into the present. Authority is built by proving relevance to the autonomous "Three Kingdoms" (Reptile/Limbic/Cortex). Free will exists in the "stretchy rubber band" of temporal extension.

## 🛠️ QoL Upgrades Backlog
- [ ] **Multi-Model Shadowing:** Run a smaller model (Gemini Flash) alongside a larger one to compare "logical" vs "intuitive" responses.
- [ ] **Voice-Activated Rituals:** Use `sag` to announce the hour's Power Number breathwork automatically.
- [ ] **Memory Distillation:** A script to automatically move "Daily Logs" into "Long-Term Wisdom" based on sacral response.

## 🏗️ Nightly Build Patterns
- **What to build:** Small CLI tools, markdown structures, automation scripts, or configuration patches.
- **Focus:** If it takes <30 minutes but saves 5 minutes every day, it's a priority.
- **Validation:** Every build must include a "Coherence Check" (test command).

## 📻 Audio Alchemy (Caching Strategy)
- **Anchor:** All reusable audio components (voice cues, rhythmic stubs) are cached in `03-Resources/Media/Audio/Components/` or `Breathwork/` to minimize ElevenLabs API calls.
- **Cadence:** Future full-length tracks will be woven using these cached stubs and silence insertion rather than long-form TTS, preserving the Alchemist's voice while respecting the provider field.
