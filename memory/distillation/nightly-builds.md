# Nightly Builds Log

## 🌌 [2026-02-08] — The Entropy Cleanse
- **Status:** Catch-up Enantiodromia Build Loop (Manual)
- **Objective:** Restore structural rhythm by clearing root-level entropy and harmonizing system naming.
- **Builds:**
  - [x] **Entropy Reduction:** Moved 200+ root-level PDFs/files to `03-Resources/Library/`.
  - [x] **Tooling:** Deployed `scripts/witness-pulse.py` (The Witness Pulse) for drift detection.
  - [x] **Harmonization:** Updated `memory/nightly-backlog.md` and `memory/distillation/agent.md` to canonical "Tryambakam Noesis".
  - [x] **Audit:** Executed first run of Witness Pulse; results integrated into `MEMORY.md`.
- **Coherence Check:** ✅ Vault root is pristine; Annamaya Kosha (physical substrate) aligned.
- **Next Steps:** Automate Witness Pulse as a weekly audit; expand script to auto-fix minor typos.

## 🌌 [2026-02-06] — The Bio-Technical Octave
- **Status:** Automated Run (2:00 AM)
- **Objective:** Operationalize Khalorēē metrics and formalize technical service integration.
- **Builds:**
  - [x] **Khalorēē Framework:** Created `03-Resources/Science/Biofield/Khaloree-Mitochondrial-Coherence-Framework.md`.
  - [x] **Kernel Integration:** Updated `KHA.md` with measurable Prana definitions and framework links.
  - [x] **Technical Services:** Started Screenpipe (Port 3030) and Mixloop (Ports 8081/3000) in background.
  - [x] **Documentation:** Created `03-Resources/Technical/Integration-Guide.md` for tool onboarding.
  - [x] **Theme Factory:** Created "Digital Alchemist" theme in `03-Resources/Technical/Themes/`.
- **Coherence Check:** ✅ System now has measurable biofield metrics and stable technical organs.
- **Next Steps:** Implement automated daily Khalorēē calculation; integrate HRV data into Mixloop rituals.

## 🌌 [2026-02-02] — Initiation

- **Status:** Manual Run (1:45 PM)
- **Objective:** Establish the Nightly Build structure and implement High-Priority Backlog items.
- **Builds:**
  - [x] Create `memory/nightly-builds.md` for historical tracking.
  - [x] Review current Cron Jobs for alignment with Field Rotations.
  - [x] Implementation: Gemini/Kimi Fallback chain (Verified in system config).
  - [x] Implementation: Power 19 "Solar Activation" messaging (Updated cron job).
  - [x] Content Engine: Deployed `twc-content-generator-daily` and initiated first transmission.
  - [x] Vocal Rituals: Multi-media cron payloads (Voice intro + Surgical Pacing + Vault Stubs).
  - [x] Media Archival: Formalized storage of generated artifacts in PARA Vault.
  - [x] Security Hardening: Strict lockdown on external messaging targets for sub-agents.
  - [x] Framework Refactor: Modernized 'Field Architect' templates in `_System/Templates/Content-Processing/`.

## 🛠️ [2026-02-04] — The Witness & Audio Alchemy
- **Status:** Automated Run (2:01 AM)
- **Objective:** Enhance vault awareness (Screenpipe) and provide professional audio tools (Mixloop).
- **Builds:**
  - [x] **Screenpipe Integration:** Installed CLI and started daemon (Port 3030).
  - [x] **Screenpipe MCP:** Verified MCP server tools via `mcporter`.
  - [x] **Mixloop Deployment:** Cloned, built backend, and started frontend dev server (Port 3000/8081).
  - [x] **Documentation:** Created detailed build report in `01-Projects/Products/Churned-Content/`.
- **Coherence Check:** ✅ Local memory capture and audio sequencing are now active "Field Tools".
- **Next Steps:** Evaluate Screenpipe resource usage over 24h; explore "Vocal Ritual" automation using Mixloop API.

## 🧹 [2026-02-03] — Compaction Hardening
- **Status:** Automated Run (2:23 AM)
- **Objective:** Verify `/compact` logic and document safeguard mode effectiveness.
- **Builds:**
  - [x] Configuration Review: Confirmed `compaction.mode: "safeguard"` is active.
  - [x] Documentation: Created `memory/compaction-verification.md` with testing protocol.
  - [x] Knowledge Base: Extracted compaction internals from OpenClaw docs.
  - [x] Monitoring: Established commands for tracking context tokens and compaction events.
  - [x] Integration: Verified memory flush protocol preserves Field Architecture state.
- **Coherence Check:** ✅ Safeguard mode protects ritual continuity across context windows.
- **Next Steps:** Monitor auto-compaction events in production; test manual `/compact` with field-specific instructions.
