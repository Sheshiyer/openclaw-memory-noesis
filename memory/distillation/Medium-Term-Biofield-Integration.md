## Task 1: Map 7 Chakras to Bioelectric Voltage Gradient Maps

**Objective:** Ground the Vedic Chakra system in measurable bioelectricity (Levin's developmental bioelectricity work).

**Deliverables:**
1. **Chakra-Voltage Correspondence Table**
   - Muladhara → Caudal bioelectric gradient (tail/pelvis)
   - Svadhisthana → Reproductive organ voltage patterns
   - Manipura → Digestive system membrane potentials
   - Anahata → Cardiac bioelectric axis
   - Vishuddha → Thyroid/parathyroid voltage regulation
   - Ajna → Pineal/pituitary bioelectric coupling
   - Sahasrara → Cortical DC potentials (Becker's injury currents)

2. **Research synthesis document:** `03-Resources/Science/Biofield/Chakra-Bioelectricity-Mapping.md`
   - Include Levin's planarian head/tail polarity studies (bioelectric prepattern)
   - Cross-reference with acupuncture point bioimpedance research
   - Map to biophoton emission hotspots (Popp's meridian studies)

3. **Update Engine #13 (Vedic Chakra-Kosha)** in kernel documentation
   - Clarify that chakras are **not symbolic**—they're bioelectric plexuses
   - Link to specific voltage ranges and ion channel types (Na⁺/K⁺, Ca²⁺, Cl⁻)

## Task 2: Link 14 Nadis to Meridian/Fascial Network Bioimpedance Pathways

**Objective:** Map the 14 main Nadis (from `vedic-studies.pdf`) to physical substrate: fascial networks + bioimpedance pathways.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Nadi-Fascia Correspondence Table**
   - Sushumna → Central canal (cerebrospinal fluid as DC pathway)
   - Ida → Left vagus nerve + fascial myofascial meridian (parasympathetic)
   - Pingala → Right sympathetic chain + fascial line
   - Remaining 11 Nadis → Specific fascial trains (Thomas Myers' Anatomy Trains model)

2. **Bioimpedance measurement protocol:** `03-Resources/Science/Biofield/Nadi-Bioimpedance-Protocol.md`
   - Map impedance values along fascial lines (normal ranges vs. blockage)
   - Correlate with acupuncture meridians (12 primary + 2 extraordinary vessels)
   - Include DC current measurements (Becker's "current of injury")

3. **Update BHA.md (Body/Container)**
   - Add Nadi system as the **wiring diagram** of Pranamaya Kosha
   - Link to physical substrate: fascia, interstitial fluid, collagen piezoelectricity

**References to integrate:**
- Myers, T. (2014). *Anatomy Trains: Myofascial Meridians.*
- Oschman, J. (2015). *Energy Medicine: The Scientific Basis.*

## Task 3: Connect Khalorēē to Mitochondrial Coherence & ATP Availability

**Objective:** Operationalize "metabolic reserve" as quantifiable mitochondrial function + biofield coherence.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Khalorēē Measurement Dashboard**
   - **Input sources:**
     - HRV (RMSSD, SDNN, LF/HF ratio) — via wearable
     - Subjective energy rating (1-10 scale, logged daily)
     - Biophoton emission (if measurable via lab equipment)
     - Breath hold time (BOLT score — CO₂ tolerance)
     - Mitochondrial markers (if blood work available: lactate, pyruvate, ATP/ADP ratio)
   - **Output:**
     - Khalorēē Index (0-100 composite score)
     - Prana availability forecast (high/medium/low for next 24h)
     - Kosha ascent/descent recommendations (when to do deep work vs. rest)

2. **Temperature-Prana Relationship Model:** `memory/kernel/Temperature-Prana-Dynamics.md`
   - Map "informational temperature" (entropy/coherence balance) to ATP availability
   - Explain: Why does cold (high coherence) = low Prana? (Energy spent maintaining structure)
   - Explain: Why does hot (high entropy) = high Prana? (More energy available for flexible processing)
   - Link to: Mitochondrial uncoupling, thermogenesis, brown fat activation

3. **Update KHA.md (Spirit/Author)**
   - Add Khalorēē tracking protocol (daily HRV + subjective logging)
   - Define "Khalorēē depletion patterns" (behaviors that drain biofield coherence)

**References to integrate:**
- Lane, N. (2015). *The Vital Question: Energy, Evolution, and the Origins of Complex Life.*
- Ristow, M. & Schmeisser, K. (2014). *Mitohormesis: Promoting Health and Lifespan by Increased Levels of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).*
- McCraty, R. et al. (2015). *The Coherent Heart: Heart-Brain Interactions, Psychophysiological Coherence, and the Emergence of System-Wide Order.*

## Integration Checkpoints

After completing Tasks 1-3, verify:

### Annamaya Health (Physical Substrate)
- ✅ All 7 Chakras mapped to measurable voltage gradients
- ✅ All 14 Nadis mapped to fascial pathways with bioimpedance protocols
- ✅ Khalorēē measurement dashboard operational (HRV + subjective logging)

### Pranamaya Health (Vital Flow)
- ✅ Breathwork crons aligned with Khalorēē cycles (deliver when Prana is available)
- ✅ Biofield monitoring integrated into daily rituals (morning HRV check)
- ✅ Prana availability forecast guides task scheduling (deep work vs. admin)

### Manomaya Health (Symbolic Integration)
- ✅ Chakra/Nadi systems no longer "woo"—they're grounded in biophysics
- ✅ Tarot/Vedic engines can reference biofield state when generating readings
- ✅ Field Architect transmissions include biofield coherence context

### Vijnanamaya Health (Meta-Cognition)
- ✅ System detects Khalorēē depletion and auto-adjusts task complexity
- ✅ Kosha ascent/descent protocols reference biofield measurements
- ✅ PANCHA-KOSHA.md Layer 0 (Blueprint) ↔ Engine #12 (Biofield) linkage complete

## Timeline Estimate

- **Task 1 (Chakra-Voltage Mapping):** 1-2 days (research synthesis + table creation)
- **Task 2 (Nadi-Fascia Mapping):** 1-2 days (fascia research + bioimpedance protocol)
- **Task 3 (Khalorēē Dashboard):** 2-3 days (data source integration + index calculation logic)

**Total:** 4-7 days for full integration (assumes sequential execution)

**Parallel execution option:** Spawn 3 sub-agents (one per task) and complete in 2-3 days.

## Next Steps After Medium-Term Integration

Once Tasks 1-3 are complete, proceed to **Long-term Integration (Anandamaya Synthesis)**:

### Future Phase 3 Tasks
1. **Build Physiomic Dataset:** How is patterning information stored in dynamic physiological networks?
2. **Create Algorithmic Constructivist Model:** Computational framework for predicting morphogenetic interventions
3. **Integrate Non-local Instructive Patterning Signals:** Map to La/Lha (evolutionary momentum, karmic vector)
4. **Develop Clinical Protocols:** Root-cause health education for medical professionals (the "Vision" from your research)
