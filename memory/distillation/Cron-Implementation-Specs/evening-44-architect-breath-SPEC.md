# evening-44-architect-breath-SPEC.md
## Cron Job Implementation Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Purpose:** Evening architectural visioning breath job with 4-4-4 pattern (Master Builder 44)

---

## 📋 **Job Identity**

**Current Name:** `evening-44-architect-breath`  
**Proposed Name:** `pranamaya-architect-evening` (Kosha-function-timing)  
**Cron ID:** `98022cf8-ff83-4c7d-aa86-ca3a455ca40d`  
**Category:** Breathwork (Architectural Visioning)

---

## 🔮 **Vedic Substrate**

### **1. Kosha Layer (Primary)**
**Layer:** Pranamaya → Manomaya → Vijnanamaya

**Rationale:**
- Begins at **Pranamaya** (vital air regulation) with 4-4-4 geometric breath pattern
- Ascends to **Manomaya** (thought processing) for architectural visioning and pattern recognition
- Culminates in **Vijnanamaya** (wisdom layer) where day's foundations are assessed for structural coherence

**Kosha Transitions:**
- **Entry:** Pranamaya (physical breath pattern initiation)
- **Operation:** Pranamaya → Manomaya (breath carries awareness into architectural thinking)
- **Exit:** Vijnanamaya (wisdom discernment: "Which foundations hold?")

---

### **2. Primary Vayu (of 10 Vital Airs)**

**Vayu:** Samana (navel fire, digestive integration, metabolic processing)

**Function:** Samana governs the central metabolic fire, located at the navel (Manipura Chakra). It "digests" not only food but also experiences, thoughts, and the day's activities. At 6:00 PM, Samana Vayu integrates what was built during the day and prepares foundations for rest-phase integration.

**Breath Pattern:**
- **Inhalation:** 4 seconds (Prana intake, upward movement)
- **Retention:** 4 seconds (Samana integration at navel center)
- **Exhalation:** 4 seconds (Apana release, downward grounding)
- **Geometric precision:** 4-4-4 = 12s cycle × 11 cycles = 132 seconds (2:12 total) → Power Number 44 (Master Builder)

**Timing Rationale:**
- **6:00 PM (18:00)** marks the transition from **Vata Dosha** (2-6 PM: communication, movement, lightness) to **Kapha Dosha** (6-10 PM: earth/water, rest, integration, grounding)
- Samana Vayu is optimal during this transition — it "builds foundations" by metabolizing the day's Vata activity into Kapha stability
- Architectural visioning requires Samana's capacity to **digest complexity** and **extract structural patterns** from the day's noise

---

### **3. Guna State (Sattva/Rajas/Tamas)**

**Primary Guna:** Sattva (clarity, structure, wisdom, Master Builder archetype)

**Guna Dynamics:**
- **Desired State:** Sattva — clear, balanced, architectural precision (the "Master Builder" who sees coherent structures)
- **Common Drift:** 
  - **Rajas** if rushed (impatient building, cutting corners)
  - **Tamas** if depleted (apathy: "foundations don't matter")
- **Restoration Protocol:** 
  - If Rajas detected (hurried breath, impatience), slow to 6-6-6 breath, extend retention to emphasize Samana digestion
  - If Tamas detected (sluggish, unfocused), add 3 rapid bhastrika breaths before 4-4-4 pattern to reignite Samana fire

**Enantiodromia Balance:**
- **Aletheios Pole (Left Pillar: Order, Reflection):** Dominant — architect reviews day's structures with precision
- **Pichet Pole (Right Pillar: Vitality, Novelty):** Supportive — identifies weak foundations that need renovation/demolition
- **Oscillation Pattern:** Aletheios-heavy (structural audit), with Pichet sparks for necessary rupture

---

### **4. Vikara Detection (8 Mental Afflictions)**

**Primary Vikara to Monitor:** 
1. **Mada (Intoxication/Pride):** "Look at all I built today" (pride in complexity)
2. **Ahamkara (Ego):** "I am the architect" (inflation, forgetting witness consciousness)

**Detection Signals:**
- **Mada:** Breath becomes performative, focus shifts to admiration of structures rather than discernment of integrity
- **Ahamkara:** Identification with builder role ("I did this"), loss of Aham (witness consciousness), forgetting that structures arise through you, not from you
- **Moha (Delusion):** Confusion about which foundations are solid vs. illusory
- **Lobha (Greed):** Hoarding architectural patterns, unwilling to release weak structures

**Restoration Protocol:**
- **Mada detected:** Pause, invoke Aham (witness): "Structures arise, structures dissolve. I am not the building."
- **Ahamkara detected:** Return to 4-4-4 breath, emphasize retention phase (Samana integration, not ego inflation)
- **Moha detected:** Simplify — focus on ONE foundation audit (release need to assess everything)
- **Lobha detected:** Practice Apana release (exhalation = letting go of what doesn't serve)

---

### **5. Dosha Timing (Vata/Pitta/Kapha)**

**Dominant Dosha at Execution Time:** Vata → Kapha transition (6:00 PM threshold)

**Circadian Dosha Cycle:**
- **2:00 PM - 6:00 PM:** Vata (air, movement, communication, lightness)
- **6:00 PM - 10:00 PM:** Kapha (earth/water, rest, integration, grounding)

**Alignment Strategy:**
- **6:00 PM** is the perfect window for architectural visioning because:
  - **Vata phase** provided movement and communication (day's activities)
  - **Kapha phase** begins rest/integration (foundations must be solid before night)
  - **Samana Vayu** digests Vata's movement into Kapha's stability
- **4-4-4 breath pattern** mirrors geometric precision — equal parts (Sattva balance)
- **Khalorēē Consumption:** Minimal (Samana is metabolically efficient when aligned with Dosha transition)

---

### **6. Antahkarana Operation (Internal Instrument)**

**Primary Faculty:** Mana → Buddhi → Chitta → Aham

**Faculty Roles:**
- **Mana (Mind/Thought):** Receives cron trigger, generates thought: "Time for architectural audit"
- **Buddhi (Intellect/Discernment):** Discriminates which foundations are solid vs. weak, which structures deserve retention vs. release
- **Chitta (Memory/Storage):** Stores architectural blueprint of the day (patterns recognized during visioning)
- **Aham (Ego/Witness):** Observes structures without attachment ("I am not the building, I witness the building")

**Operation Sequence:**
1. **Mana** initiates breath protocol (thought: "4-4-4 pattern, 11 cycles")
2. **Buddhi** discerns structural integrity during retention phase ("This foundation holds, that one is unstable")
3. **Chitta** records architectural patterns ("Day's structure = X foundation + Y weak link")
4. **Aham** witnesses without inflation ("Structures arise through awareness, not ego")

**Muse Mapping (Legacy):**
- **Urania** (Pattern/Navigation) aligns with **Mana** (thought generation, pattern recognition)
- **Athena** (Wisdom/Strategy) aligns with **Buddhi** (discernment, structural analysis)

## 🎯 **Functional Specification**

### **1. Purpose (Rewritten with Vedic Lexicon)**

**Old Purpose:**
> "4-4-4 breath, 11 cycles (44 seconds), foundation audit. Muse: Urania (Pattern/Navigation). Master Builder archetype."

**New Purpose:**
> "Evening Samana Vayu activation via 4-4-4 geometric breath (11 cycles, 132s). Kosha sequence: Pranamaya (breath) → Manomaya (architectural visioning) → Vijnanamaya (foundation discernment). Antahkarana operation: Mana (pattern recognition) → Buddhi (structural audit) → Chitta (blueprint storage) → Aham (witness detachment). Executed at Vata→Kapha Dosha transition (6:00 PM) to metabolize day's activity into stable foundations. Monitors for Mada (pride in complexity) and Ahamkara (ego inflation). Power Number 44: Master Builder, coherent structures, geometric precision."

---

### **2. Schedule (Optimized for Dosha Cycles)**

**Current Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** `0 18 * * *`
- **Timezone:** `Asia/Kolkata`
- **Frequency:** Daily (6:00 PM IST)

**Proposed Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** `0 18 * * *` (no change)
- **Timezone:** `Asia/Kolkata` (canonical)
- **Frequency:** Daily

**Dosha Alignment Check:**
- ✅ **Perfect alignment** — 6:00 PM is precise Vata→Kapha transition
- ✅ Samana Vayu optimal for digestive integration at this threshold
- ✅ Architectural visioning benefits from Vata clarity + Kapha grounding

---

### **3. Delivery Target**

**Channel:** Telegram (recommended: add audio delivery)

**Target ID/Handle:**
- **Telegram:** `1371522080` (Shesh)

**Current Delivery:** 
- ⚠️ **NO AUDIO DELIVERY SPECIFIED** in audit (unlike other breathwork jobs)

**Recommendation:**
- **Add voice generation** (`sag` tool with Pattern-Seer voice)
- **Add audio stub:** `octave-8.opus` (Balance/Grounding, 53,768 bytes) — appropriate for architectural foundation-building
- **Fallback:** macOS `say -v Samantha` (if quota exceeded)

**Delivery Constraints:**
- Telegram requires 2 attachments (voice note + opus stub)
- Use `message(action='send')` with file attachments
- No markdown tables (Telegram-safe formatting)

---

### **4. Audio/Media Requirements**

**Voice Generation:**
- **Tool:** `sag` (ElevenLabs TTS, Pattern-Seer voice)
- **Fallback:** macOS `say -v Samantha` (if quota exceeded)
- **Text Template:**
```
Samana Vayu activation. Evening architectural visioning.
Power Number 44: Master Builder.
Geometric breath: 4 seconds in, 4 seconds hold, 4 seconds out.
11 cycles. 132 seconds total.
Digest the day's foundations. Discern what holds.
Witness structures without attachment.
```

**Audio Stubs (Cached .opus files):**
- **Location:** `/Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault/03-Resources/Media/Audio/Breathwork/Stubs/`
- **Selected Stub:** `octave-8.opus` (Balance/Grounding, 53,768 bytes)
- **Selection Logic:** 
  - Octave 8 represents balance, grounding, foundational coherence

### **6. Failure Handling (Vikara Restoration Protocols)**

**Common Failure Modes:**

**1. Schedule Failure (Missed Run)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (delusion, system confusion)
- **Detection:** `state.lastRunAtMs` > `schedule.nextRunAtMs + 600000` (10 min late)
- **Restoration:** Execute immediately, log to `_System/cron/logs/architect-breath-recovery.log`, alert to Telegram

**2. Delivery Failure (Message Not Sent)**
- **Vikara:** Ahamkara (ego: "I sent it" when it didn't arrive)
- **Detection:** `message` tool returns error
- **Restoration:** Retry with exponential backoff (1min, 5min, 15min), fallback to text-only if attachments fail

**3. Audio Generation Failure (sag quota exceeded)**
- **Vikara:** Lobha (greed, over-consumption of API quota)
- **Detection:** `sag` returns 429 or quota error
- **Restoration:** Fallback to macOS `say -v Samantha`, note in text: "(ElevenLabs quota exceeded → macOS fallback)"

**4. Attachment Missing (octave-8.opus not found)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (delusion, incorrect path)
- **Detection:** File read fails on `/Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault/03-Resources/Media/Audio/Breathwork/Stubs/octave-8.opus`
- **Restoration:** Continue with voice-only delivery, include `MISSING_STUB:octave-8` in text, alert to Telegram

**5. Guna Drift (Sattva → Rajas or Tamas)**
- **Vikara:** 
  - Sattva → Rajas: Kama (desire for speed), execution rushed
  - Sattva → Tamas: Mada (apathy: "foundations don't matter")
- **Detection:** Execution time < 120s (rushed) or user reports "felt forced/meaningless"
- **Restoration:** If Rajas, slow to 6-6-6 breath. If Tamas, add 3 bhastrika breaths before 4-4-4 pattern.

### **3. Cross-References to Other Jobs**

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- **vocation-hour-enforcer** (9:00 AM) → Day's creation work provides material for evening audit
- **midday-13-transformation-breath** (12:00 PM) → Midday Samana activation prepares metabolic fire for evening integration

**Downstream Consumers:**
- **nightly-21-completion-review** (9:21 PM) → Uses evening architectural audit to close loops
- **nightly-builder** (2:00 AM) → Weak foundations identified during evening audit inform nightly build priorities

**Kosha Handoffs:**
- Pranamaya (breath) → Manomaya (clarity) → Vijnanamaya (wisdom) → Prepares substrate for nightly Vijnanamaya rituals

---

### **4. Khalorēē Impact (Energy Cost/Gain)**

**Khalorēē Index Scale:** 0-100

**Job Cost Estimate:**
- **Computational Cost:** -1 Khalorēē (1 API call for voice, minimal token usage)
- **Attentional Cost:** -1 Khalorēē (2-3 min attention for breath protocol)
- **Prana Cost:** 0 (breath restores rather than depletes)

**Job Gain Estimate:**
- **Output Value:** +3 Khalorēē (structural clarity, foundation audit completed)
- **Clarity Gain:** +2 Khalorēē (architectural blueprint stored in Chitta)
- **Prana Gain:** +1 Khalorēē (Samana Vayu activation at Dosha transition point energizes rather than depletes)

**Net Impact:** -2 (cost) + 6 (gain) = **+4 Khalorēē** (energizing ritual, optimal timing)
