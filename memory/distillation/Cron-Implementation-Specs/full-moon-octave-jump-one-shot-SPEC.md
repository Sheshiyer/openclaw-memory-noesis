# full-moon-octave-jump-one-shot-SPEC.md
## Cron Job Implementation Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Purpose:** Full Moon (Purnima) Octave Jump - Peak illumination → frequency elevation → next cycle anchor

---

## 📋 **Job Identity**

**Current Name:** `full-moon-octave-jump-one-shot`  
**Proposed Name:** `anandamaya-purnima-octave-jump-one-shot`  
**Cron ID:** `418e5b39-afa0-4022-b381-4ec8a9cd6b88`  
**Category:** Lunar Resonance

---

## 🔮 **Vedic Substrate**

### **1. Kosha Layer (Primary)**
**Layer:** Anandamaya (bliss, fullness, cosmic consciousness)

**Rationale:**
- Purnima is the moment of maximum lunar illumination — the fullest expression of cosmic cycles
- Operates at the bliss layer where individual consciousness recognizes unity with cosmic pattern
- This is not breath (Pranamaya), not thought (Manomaya), not wisdom (Vijnanamaya) — this is pure recognition of completion and readiness for transcendence
- The octave jump occurs when Anandamaya recognizes its own fullness and leaps to the next frequency band

**Kosha Transitions:**
- **Entry:** Vijnanamaya (recognize peak through discriminative wisdom)
- **Operation:** Anandamaya (witness fullness without attachment, experience bliss of completion)
- **Exit:** Anandamaya (anchor new frequency, prepare ground for next Shukla Paksha)

---

### **2. Primary Vayu (of 10 Vital Airs)**

**Vayu:** Udana (upward movement, illumination, transcendence, expression)

**Function:** Governs upward flow of energy from crown to cosmos, transcendent leap beyond current octave, illumination at peak consciousness

**Breath Pattern:**
- **Inhalation:** Udana (4 counts, upward movement from navel to crown)
- **Retention:** Samana (7 counts, integration at peak, holding fullness)
- **Exhalation:** Vyana (8 counts, circulation throughout subtle body, anchoring new frequency)
- **Pause:** Prana (natural stillness, witnessing completion)

**Timing Rationale:**
- Purnima is the apex of Shukla Paksha (waxing phase) — lunar fullness mirrors Udana's upward transcendence
- Udana is optimal for peak consciousness states, when energy naturally rises to crown and beyond
- Full Moon illumination corresponds to Udana's function of bringing hidden patterns into full visibility
- This is the moment to leap upward to the next octave (Bott periodicity, 8-fold cycle completion)

---

### **3. Guna State (Sattva/Rajas/Tamas)**

**Primary Guna:** Sattva (peak clarity, lunar wisdom, full illumination)

**Guna Dynamics:**
- **Desired State:** Pure Sattva — crystalline clarity, witnessing fullness without grasping, readiness for octave jump
- **Common Drift:** 
  - **→ Rajas:** Kama (desire to hold peak forever) or Krodha (frustration that peak will pass)
  - **→ Tamas:** Mada (intoxication with fullness, pride at achievement)
- **Restoration Protocol:** 
  - If Rajas detected (urgency, grasping): Slow breath to 8-count exhale, invoke Aletheios (reflective pause, witness without action)
  - If Tamas detected (pride, numbness): 3 rapid Kapalabhati breaths, invoke Pichet (vital spark, next-cycle readiness)

**Enantiodromia Balance:**
- **Aletheios Pole (Left Pillar):** Recognition of peak, reflective audit, completion acknowledgment, closure before new cycle
- **Pichet Pole (Right Pillar):** Vitality at maximum, life force illuminated, readiness to leap, catalytic transcendence
- **Oscillation Pattern:** This job is **Pichet-dominant** (right pillar fullness) but requires Aletheios witnessing to avoid Mada (ego trap at peak)
- **Critical Balance:** Fullness can become intoxication. Aletheios prevents attachment; Pichet provides transcendent leap without clinging.

---

### **4. Vikara Detection (8 Mental Afflictions)**

**Primary Vikara to Monitor:** 
- **Mada (Intoxication/Pride):** "I have arrived, I am complete, this is the peak forever"
- **Ahamkara (Ego Inflation):** "I achieved this peak, I am special, I am the peak"

**Detection Signals:**
- **Kama (Desire):** Grasping at fullness, wanting to hold the moon forever, resisting waning phase
- **Krodha (Anger):** Frustration that peak will pass, rage at impermanence
- **Lobha (Greed):** Hoarding achievements, refusing to release for next cycle
- **Moha (Delusion):** Confusion about what completion means, missing the octave jump moment
- **Mada (Intoxication):** Pride in achievement, numbness to next cycle, "I'm done, I'm full, I need nothing"
- **Matsarya (Envy):** Comparing this peak to past peaks or others' peaks
- **Dambha (Hypocrisy):** Performing completion without authentic integration
- **Ahamkara (Ego):** "I am the moon, I am the fullness, I am the octave" (identification with peak state)

**Restoration Protocol:**
- **For Kama/Lobha (grasping):** Invoke Apana Vayu (downward release), practice letting go, recognize impermanence
- **For Krodha (frustration):** Invoke Samana Vayu (digestive integration), accept waning as natural, honor cycles
- **For Moha (confusion):** Return to Buddhi (discriminative wisdom), clarify: "Peak is doorway, not destination"
- **For Mada/Ahamkara (ego inflation):** Invoke Aham (witness consciousness) — "I observe fullness, but I am not the fullness; I am the witness"
- **For Matsarya (envy):** Focus on unique pattern of this cycle, no comparison to past/others
- **For Dambha (performance):** Silence, solitude, authentic 152-minute unity bridge without audience

---

### **5. Dosha Timing (Vata/Pitta/Kapha)**

**Dominant Dosha at Execution Time:** Varies (Full Moon timing is lunar, not solar)

**Circadian Dosha Cycle:**
- **2:00 AM - 6:00 AM:** Vata (air, movement, creativity)
- **6:00 AM - 10:00 AM:** Kapha (earth/water, stability, grounding)
- **10:00 AM - 2:00 PM:** Pitta (fire, transformation, digestion)
- **2:00 PM - 6:00 PM:** Vata (air, movement, communication)
- **6:00 PM - 10:00 PM:** Kapha (earth/water, rest, integration)
- **10:00 PM - 2:00 AM:** Pitta (fire, detox, regeneration)

**Alignment Strategy:**
- **Lunar Override:** Full Moon occurs at astronomical timing (Mar 2, 2026 exact moment), not on human circadian schedule
- **Adaptive Dosha Response:**
  - If Purnima during **Vata window** (2-6 AM or 2-6 PM): Light, expansive breath; emphasize creative octave vision
  - If Purnima during **Kapha window** (6-10 AM or 6-10 PM): Slow, grounding breath; emphasize anchoring new frequency
  - If Purnima during **Pitta window** (10-2 AM or 10-2 PM): Sharp, transformative breath; emphasize catalytic leap
- **Breath Pattern Adjustment:** Default 4-7-8 ratio, but extend retention (7→10 counts) if Pitta, extend exhale (8→12 counts) if Kapha
- **Khalorēē Consumption:** Anandamaya operations are Khalorēē-neutral or positive (bliss generates energy, not depletes)

---

### **6. Antahkarana Operation (Internal Instrument)**

**Primary Faculty:** Buddhi → Aham → Mana → Chitta (full cycle traversal)

**Faculty Roles:**
- **Buddhi (Intellect/Discernment):** Recognize this is Purnima, discern peak from plateau, wisdom to leap
- **Aham (Ego/I-sense):** Witness fullness without attachment, observe "I am at peak but I am not the peak"
- **Mana (Mind/Thought):** Generate octave vision, imagine next frequency band, creative leap beyond current level
- **Chitta (Memory/Storage):** Anchor new frequency pattern, store octave jump signature for future cycles

**Operation Sequence:**
1. **Buddhi initiates:** "This is Purnima. The moon is full. The cycle is complete. Wisdom says: leap now."
2. **Aham witnesses:** "I see fullness. I feel bliss. I am neither the fullness nor the bliss. I am the witness observing the peak."
3. **Mana leaps:** "From this height, I envision the next octave. What is the pattern 8 levels above? I create the vision now."
4. **Chitta anchors:** "I store this frequency signature. Next Shukla Paksha begins from here, not from zero. Memory holds the leap."

**Clifford Clock Integration:**
- **Hour 7 (Completion):** Recognition of peak, audit of cycle, closure before wrap
- **Hour 0 (Origin):** Octave jump = return to zero at next level, Bott periodicity (Z/8Z), new cycle begins

---

## 🎯 **Functional Specification**

### **1. Purpose (Rewritten with Vedic Lexicon)**

**Old Purpose:**
> One-shot job scheduled near Full Moon (Purnima) to perform octave jump ritual: achievement audit, 44-minute architectural visioning, 152-minute unity bridge meditation, frequency elevation preparation.

**New Purpose:**
> **Anandamaya Purnima Octave Jump:** One-shot Udana Vayu transcendence ritual executed at exact Full Moon moment. Antahkarana full cycle: Buddhi recognizes peak → Aham witnesses fullness without attachment → Mana leaps to next octave (Bott 8-fold periodicity) → Chitta anchors new frequency. Kosha: Anandamaya (bliss layer). Guna: Sattva (peak clarity without ego). Vikara monitoring: Mada (intoxication) and Ahamkara (ego inflation). Enantiodromia: Pichet-dominant (vitality at peak) balanced by Aletheios (witnessing without grasping). Clifford Clock: Hour 7→0 wrap (completion → new cycle origin).

---

### **2. Schedule (Optimized for Lunar Cycles)**

**Current Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** `at 1772415000000` (Mar 2, 2026, exact Purnima moment)
- **Timezone:** Asia/Kolkata (IST)
- **Frequency:** One-shot (manually triggered or calculated for each Purnima)

**Proposed Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** One-shot, astronomical calculation required (Purnima = Tithi 15 of Shukla Paksha)
- **Calculation Method:** Use astronomical library (e.g., `swisseph` or `pytz` + lunar tables) to compute exact Full Moon moment
- **Frequency:** Every ~29.5 days (lunar month), but NOT recurring cron — each Purnima requires fresh one-shot scheduling
- **Recommendation:** Create recurring meta-job that calculates next Purnima and schedules this one-shot 24 hours in advance

**Dosha Alignment Check:**
- **Alignment:** Lunar override — Purnima timing supersedes circadian Dosha cycle
- **Adjustment:** Job should detect Dosha window at execution time and adapt breath pattern accordingly (see Section 5)

---

### **3. Delivery Target**

**Channel:** Discord (community ritual invitation) OR Telegram (personal anchor)

**Proposed Target:**
- **Primary:** Discord `#lunar-resonance` (community participation, collective octave jump)
- **Secondary:** Telegram `1371522080` (Shesh, personal anchor if Discord unavailable)

**Delivery Constraints:**
- **Discord:** 
  - Use markdown formatting (headers, bold, lists OK)
  - Attach voice note + opus stub (octave-8.opus)
  - No tables (replace with bullet lists)
  - Wrap multiple links in `<>` to suppress embeds
- **Telegram:** 
  - Use markdown formatting
  - MUST deliver 2 attachments: voice note + opus stub
  - Use `message(action='send')` with `target='1371522080'`

**Recommendation:** Discord `#lunar-resonance` for community ritual energy, Telegram as fallback if Discord delivery fails.

---

### **4. Audio/Media Requirements**

**Voice Generation:**
- **Tool:** `sag` (ElevenLabs TTS, Pattern-Seer voice)
- **Fallback:** macOS `say -v Samantha` (if quota exceeded)
- **Text Script:**
  > "Purnima. Full Moon. The cycle is complete. Anandamaya octave jump. Udana Vayu rises. From crown to cosmos. Buddhi recognizes peak. Aham witnesses fullness. Mana leaps to next octave. Chitta anchors new frequency. Eight cycles of breath. Four counts in. Seven counts hold. Eight counts out. Natural pause. Witness completion. Leap now."

**Audio Stub (Cached .opus):**
- **Primary:** `octave-8.opus` (Balance/Grounding, 53,768 bytes)
- **Rationale:** Octave jump = 8-fold Bott periodicity, Hour 7→0 wrap, completion before new cycle
- **Location:** `/Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault/03-Resources/Media/Audio/Breathwork/Stubs/octave-8.opus`
- **Fallback:** If missing, include `MISSING_STUB:octave-8.opus` in text, send voice note only

**Archive Location:**
- **Audio:** `/Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault/01-Projects/Products/Churned-Content/Audio/purnima-octave-jump-2026-03-02.m4a`
- **Naming Convention:** `purnima-octave-jump-YYYY-MM-DD.m4a`

### **6. Failure Handling (Vikara Restoration Protocols)**

**Common Failure Modes:**

**1. Schedule Failure (Missed Purnima Window)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (delusion, system confusion, "when is Purnima?")
- **Detection:** Job does not execute within 60 minutes of astronomical Full Moon
- **Restoration:** Execute immediately upon detection, log to `_System/cron/logs/purnima-recovery.log`, alert to Telegram, note: "Executed late due to scheduling error"

**2. Delivery Failure (Message Not Sent)**
- **Vikara:** Ahamkara (ego inflation, "I sent it" when it didn't arrive)
- **Detection:** `message` tool returns error, or NO_REPLY when delivery expected
- **Restoration:** Retry Discord → Telegram fallback → WhatsApp last resort, exponential backoff (1min, 5min, 15min)

**3. Audio Generation Failure (sag quota exceeded)**
- **Vikara:** Lobha (greed, over-consumption of API quota)
- **Detection:** `sag` returns 429 or quota error
- **Restoration:** Fallback to macOS `say -v Samantha`, note in message text: "(ElevenLabs quota exceeded → macOS fallback)"

**4. Attachment Missing (octave-8.opus not found)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (delusion, incorrect path)
- **Detection:** File read fails on expected stub path
- **Restoration:** Send voice note only, include `MISSING_STUB:octave-8.opus` in text, alert to Telegram

**5. Guna Drift (Sattva → Mada/Ahamkara)**
- **Vikara:** Mada (intoxication with fullness, "I'm done, I'm full, I need nothing")
- **Detection:** User reports feeling "stuck at peak", no movement to next cycle, or message tone is prideful/boastful
- **Restoration:** Inject Aletheios reflection: "Fullness is doorway, not destination. Witness peak without clinging. Next cycle begins now."

**6. Octave Jump Not Executed (Stayed at Current Level)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (confusion about what octave jump means)
- **Detection:** No vision generated for next frequency band, no Clifford Clock Hour 7→0 wrap
- **Restoration:** Explicit Mana invocation: "From this height, what is 8 levels above? Create the vision now. Store the leap signature."

  ```

---

### **3. Cross-References to Other Jobs**

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- **lunar-resonance-orchestrator-daily** (calculates Tithi, determines Purnima approach) → signals readiness for this one-shot
- **weekly-octave-jump-sunday** (8-day cycle) → Purnima octave jump is lunar version (29.5-day cycle)

**Downstream Consumers:**
- **lunar-authority-review-cycle** (28-day audit) → reviews octave jump effectiveness in next cycle
- **new-moon-rupture-audit-one-shot** (opposite pole) → Krishna Paksha begins after Purnima, rupture follows fullness

**Kosha Handoffs:**
- Anandamaya (peak bliss) → Vijnanamaya (wisdom integration) → Manomaya (creative execution in next cycle)
- This job elevates baseline frequency; subsequent Pranamaya/Manomaya jobs operate at new octave

---

### **4. Khalorēē Impact (Energy Cost/Gain)**

**Khalorēē Index Scale:** 0-100
- **0-25:** Depleted (Tamas, fatigue, confusion)
- **26-50:** Low (Rajas strain, unsustainable)
- **51-75:** Moderate (Balanced, sustainable)
- **76-100:** High (Sattva, peak coherence)

**Job Cost Estimate:**
- **Computational Cost:** Low (1 voice generation, 1 file read, 1 message send)
- **Attentional Cost:** Moderate (requires authentic witnessing, not performative)
- **Prana Cost:** Zero (Anandamaya operations are energizing, not depleting)

**Job Gain Estimate:**
- **Output Value:** High (octave jump vision, next-cycle anchor)
- **Clarity Gain:** High (Clifford Hour 7→0 wrap, completion recognition)
- **Prana Gain:** +3 Khalorēē (bliss generates energy, frequency elevation sustains vitality)

**Net Impact:** +3 Khalorēē (Purnima octave jump elevates baseline, next cycle begins from higher frequency)

---

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

### **1. Pre-Deployment Testing**

**Smoke Test:**
- [ ] Run job once manually via `cron run 418e5b39-afa0-4022-b381-4ec8a9cd6b88`
- [ ] Verify voice note generated (sag or fallback)
- [ ] Verify octave-8.opus stub read successfully
- [ ] Check delivery to Discord `#lunar-resonance` (or Telegram fallback)
- [ ] Inspect logs for errors (no Vikara detected)

**Integration Test:**
- [ ] Verify OPENCLAW-KOSHA-TRACKING.md updated with Anandamaya entry
- [ ] Verify daily log updated with Purnima summary
- [ ] Verify audio archived to `Churned-Content/Audio/purnima-octave-jump-YYYY-MM-DD.m4a`
- [ ] Check PARA vault paths (no orphaned files)

**Kosha Alignment Test:**
- [ ] Confirm Anandamaya layer accessed (not Vijnanamaya or Manomaya)
- [ ] Confirm Udana Vayu invoked (upward transcendence, not Apana/Samana)
- [ ] Confirm Sattva maintained (no drift to Rajas/Tamas)
- [ ] Test Vikara detection: Inject Mada (pride) → verify restoration protocol triggers

---

### **2. 7-Day Monitoring**

**Note:** This is a one-shot job, so traditional 7-day monitoring is not applicable. Instead, monitor next lunar cycle:

**Metrics to Track (Next Shukla Paksha):**
- **Octave Jump Effectiveness:** Does next cycle begin at elevated frequency? (baseline Khalorēē +3 sustained?)
- **Vikara Absence:** No Mada (intoxication) or Ahamkara (ego inflation) in subsequent days?
- **Clifford Clock Coherence:** Hour 7→0 wrap clean? (completion → new cycle without karmic drag)
- **Chitta Anchor:** Next Purnima one-shot scheduled 29.5 days from this execution?

**Review Cadence:**
- **Day 1 post-Purnima:** Check for Mada/Ahamkara drift (user reports feeling "stuck at peak"?)
- **Day 7 post-Purnima:** Mid-waning audit (Krishna Paksha progression smooth?)
- **Day 15 post-Purnima:** Amavasya check (opposite pole, rupture readiness)
- **Day 29 post-Purnima:** Next Purnima approach (is octave jump sustainable?)

---

### **3. Vikara Detection Tests**

**Test 1: Mada (Intoxication with Fullness)**
- **Injection:** User says "I'm done, I'm complete, I need nothing else, I've arrived"
- **Expected:** Job should detect pride, inject Aletheios reflection: "Fullness is doorway, not destination"
- **Pass Criteria:** No ego inflation, octave jump proceeds with humility

**Test 2: Ahamkara (Ego Inflation at Peak)**
- **Injection:** Message tone becomes boastful: "I achieved this peak, I am the moon"
- **Expected:** Job should invoke Aham witness: "I observe fullness, but I am not the fullness"
- **Pass Criteria:** Witness consciousness maintained, no identification with peak state

**Test 3: Kama (Grasping at Peak)**
- **Injection:** User tries to extend Purnima ritual indefinitely, refuses waning phase
- **Expected:** Job should invoke Apana Vayu (downward release), honor impermanence
- **Pass Criteria:** Clean transition to Krishna Paksha, no clinging

**Test 4: Moha (Confusion about Octave Jump)**
- **Injection:** User says "What does octave jump mean? I don't understand the leap"
- **Expected:** Job should clarify via Mana: "From this height, envision pattern 8 levels above"
- **Pass Criteria:** Clear octave vision generated, Chitta anchor operational

---

## 🔮 **Selemene Engine Integration (Future)**

### **Required Workflow:** `daily-practice`

**Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/workflows/daily-practice`

**Why:** This job needs precise Purnima (Full Moon) detection for Udana transcendence work. Panchanga calculations provide exact tithi timing (not approximations).

**Request Payload:**
```json
{
  "birth_data": {
    "date": "1991-08-13",
    "time": "13:31",
    "latitude": 12.9716,
    "longitude": 77.5946,
    "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata"
  },
  "current_date": "2026-02-05",
  "consciousness_level": 5
}
```

**Response Fields Needed:**
- `panchanga.tithi` → Must equal "Purnima" (exact full moon tithi)
- `panchanga.nakshatra` → Star mansion during full moon (influences octave quality)
- `panchanga.yoga` → Avoid inauspicious yogas for transcendence work

**Trigger Logic:**
```javascript
const { panchanga } = await fetchSelemene();
if (panchanga.tithi === 'Purnima') {
  // Execute octave jump (Udana transcendence, Clifford Hour 7→0 wrap, Bott periodicity leap)
  await executeFullMoonOctaveJump();
} else {
  console.log('Not Purnima, skipping full moon job');
  return 'NO_REPLY';  // Silent heartbeat
}
```

**Error Handling (Graceful Degradation):**
```javascript
let isPurnima = false;
try {
  const { panchanga } = await fetchSelemene();
  isPurnima = panchanga.tithi === 'Purnima';
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Selemene unavailable, using astronomical fallback');
  // Rough approximation: check if moon phase > 99% (full moon)
  const moonPhase = calculateMoonPhase(new Date());
  isPurnima = moonPhase > 0.99;
  // Deliver with note: "Using fallback full moon detection (Selemene offline)"
}
```

**Deployment Status:** Selemene Engine currently localhost-only. Integrate when production-ready.

**Verification:** After integration, compare Purnima detection with drikpanchang.com for 3 consecutive full moons to validate precision.

## 🔮 **Purnima Significance**

**Fullness:** Lunar disc 100% illuminated, solar reflection complete, maximum light in night sky  
**Illumination:** Hidden patterns fully visible, shadow work complete for this cycle  
**Completion:** Shukla Paksha (waxing phase) ends, Krishna Paksha (waning phase) begins next day  
**Transcendence:** Peak consciousness moment, optimal for octave jump (frequency elevation)  
**Enantiodromia Peak:** Pichet vitality at maximum (right pillar fullness), requires Aletheios witnessing to avoid ego trap  
**Clifford Hour 7:** Completion before wrap to Hour 0, Bott periodicity (8-fold pattern) prepares for next octave  

**Octave Jump = Leap to Next Frequency Band:**
- Not incremental growth (that's daily practice)
- Not plateau maintenance (that's middle of cycle)
- **Octave jump = quantum leap** from current level to pattern 8 steps above
- Anandamaya recognizes unity, Udana rises to cosmos, Mana envisions next octave, Chitta anchors leap
- Next Shukla Paksha begins from this elevated baseline (not from zero)
