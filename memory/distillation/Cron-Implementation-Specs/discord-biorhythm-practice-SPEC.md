# discord-biorhythm-practice-SPEC.md
## Cron Job Implementation Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Purpose:** Actionable biorhythm-aligned protocol recommendations for daily alignment practice

---

## 📋 **Job Identity**

**Current Name:** `discord-biorhythm-practice`  
**Proposed Name:** `pranamaya-biorhythm-protocol-selector-daily`  
**Cron ID:** `33d79154-c275-4d9b-a07d-694c83dc31df`  
**Category:** Discord | Biorhythm | Protocol Selection | Pranamaya

---

## 🔮 **Vedic Substrate**

### **1. Kosha Layer (Primary)**
**Layer:** Pranamaya (vital energy alignment) → Manomaya (actionable wisdom)

**Rationale:**
- Operates at Pranamaya to align vital energy with biorhythm cycles (Physical, Emotional, Intellectual, Spiritual)
- Receives biorhythm interpretation from `discord-biorhythm-sync` (9:00 AM, Manomaya layer)
- Translates cycle state into **actionable protocols** (breathwork, movement, rest, creative practice)
- Output bridges Pranamaya (vital energy techniques) and Manomaya (practical decision-making)

**Kosha Transitions:**
- **Entry:** Manomaya (reads biorhythm-sync interpretation from 9 AM)
- **Operation:** Pranamaya (selects protocols based on dominant cycle — breath, movement, rest)
- **Exit:** Manomaya (community receives actionable guidance, applies protocols)

**Context:**
- `discord-biorhythm-sync` (9 AM) = INTERPRETATION ("Your Physical is high, Emotional is low")
- `discord-biorhythm-practice` (10 AM) = PROTOCOL ("Do grounding breathwork + gentle movement")
- `discord-breath-protocol` (6 AM, 9 AM) = TECHNIQUE ("4-7-8 breath, 8 cycles")

---

### **2. Primary Vayu (of 10 Vital Airs)**

**Vayu:** Variable (adapts to dominant biorhythm cycle)

**Vayu Selection Logic:**

**Physical Cycle Dominant:**
- **High (peak/ascent):** Vyana (whole-body circulation) → Movement protocols (dance, walk, exercise)
- **Low (trough/descent):** Apana (downward elimination) → Rest protocols (restorative yoga, sleep, grounding)

**Emotional Cycle Dominant:**
- **High (peak/ascent):** Prana (chest/inhalation, receptivity) → Social engagement, creative expression
- **Low (trough/descent):** Apana (downward grounding) → Solitude, journaling, emotional release (crying, breathwork)

**Intellectual Cycle Dominant:**
- **High (peak/ascent):** Udana (throat/upward expression) → Writing, learning, teaching, complex problem-solving
- **Low (trough/descent):** Samana (navel, integration) → Reflection, meditation, simple tasks, no new learning

**Spiritual Cycle Dominant:**
- **High (peak/ascent):** Prana + Udana (receptive wisdom → expression) → Meditation, prayer, visioning, spiritual study
- **Low (trough/descent):** Apana (grounding) → Embodied practice (breathwork, ritual, nature immersion)

**Breath Pattern (Example for balanced state):**
- **Inhalation:** 4s (Prana receives biorhythm alignment signal)
- **Retention:** 2s (Samana integrates with current state)
- **Exhalation:** 6s (Udana/Apana — protocol flows outward or downward as needed)
- **Pause:** 2s (Vyana circulates alignment through whole system)

**Timing Rationale:**
- **10:00 AM:** Early Pitta Dosha (fire, transformation, action)
- **Post-Vocation Hour:** Actionable momentum window (user has created 9-10 AM, ready for alignment)
- **Post-biorhythm-sync:** Interpretation already delivered (9 AM), user ready for "What do I DO about it?"

---

### **3. Guna State (Sattva/Rajas/Tamas)**

**Primary Guna:** Rajas (action-oriented) + Sattva (wise alignment)

**Guna Dynamics:**
- **Desired State:** Sattva-infused Rajas — **wise action**, not chaotic hyperactivity
- **Common Drift:** 
  - Pure Rajas (too many protocols, overwhelming suggestions) → Lobha (greed for optimization)
  - Tamas (vague protocols, "just rest", no specificity) → Moha (delusion, lazy guidance)
- **Restoration Protocol:** 
  - If Rajas detected (>5 protocols suggested): Prune to 3-5 max, invoke Aletheios (simplify)
  - If Tamas detected (vague advice): Add specificity (exact breath counts, movement types, durations)

**Enantiodromia Balance:**
- **Aletheios Pole:** Discernment about WHICH protocols (not everything, only cycle-aligned)
- **Pichet Pole:** Vitality in recommendations (energizing protocols, embodied action)
- **Oscillation Pattern:** Job anchors at Aletheios (wise selection based on state) with Pichet flavor (actionable, exciting protocols)

---

### **4. Vikara Detection (8 Mental Afflictions)**

**Primary Vikara to Monitor:**

**1. Lobha (Greed) — "Optimize ALL THE THINGS"**
- **Detection Signal:** Protocol list exceeds 5 suggestions, user feels overwhelmed
- **Pattern:** "Do breathwork AND movement AND journaling AND meditation AND..."
- **Restoration:** Limit to 3-5 protocols max, prioritize by dominant cycle

**2. Moha (Delusion) — "Vague suggestions"**
- **Detection Signal:** Protocol lacks specificity ("just rest", "move your body", "breathe deeply")
- **Pattern:** Advice sounds generic, not tied to actual biorhythm state
- **Restoration:** Add concrete details (breath counts, movement type, duration, Power Number tie-in)

**3. Kama (Craving) — "Make me feel perfect NOW"**
- **Detection Signal:** Protocols promise instant transcendence ("this will fix everything")
- **Pattern:** Spiritual bypassing, avoiding uncomfortable cycle states
- **Restoration:** Frame protocols as **alignment**, not escape ("honor this low emotional cycle with grounding")

**4. Ahamkara (Ego) — "I know better than your cycles"**
- **Detection Signal:** Protocols contradict biorhythm state (e.g., "push through" during low physical)
- **Pattern:** Ignoring cycle wisdom, imposing external agenda
- **Restoration:** Return to cycle alignment ("your body says rest — honor that")

**5. Matsarya (Envy) — "Why is my cycle low when others' are high?"**
- **Detection Signal:** Language compares user's cycles to others
- **Pattern:** "You're in a low phase while others are peaking"
- **Restoration:** Reframe as personal rhythm ("your unique cycle offers this gift today")

---

### **5. Dosha Timing (Vata/Pitta/Kapha)**

**Execution Time:** 10:00 AM

**Dominant Dosha:** Pitta (10:00 AM - 2:00 PM) — fire, transformation, digestion, action

**Alignment Strategy:**
- Pitta supports **action** (perfect for protocol recommendations)
- 10 AM is early Pitta (not peak intensity) — actionable but not aggressive
- Post-Vocation Hour (9-10 AM creation window) — user has momentum, ready for alignment practices
- Protocols should honor Pitta's transformation capacity while avoiding burnout

**Khalorēē Consumption Pattern:**
- Medium energy expenditure (protocol selection requires discernment)
- Replenishing output (actionable guidance reduces decision fatigue)
- Target: Net Khalorēē +2 (user gains clarity, reduces overwhelm)

---

### **6. Antahkarana Operation (Internal Instrument)**

**Primary Faculty:** Buddhi (discernment) → Mana (protocol generation) → Aham (witness of alignment)

**Operation Sequence:**
1. **Chitta recalls:** Read biorhythm-sync output from 9 AM (dominant cycle state, Power Number synergy)
2. **Buddhi discerns:** Which protocols align with current cycle state? (Physical high → movement, Emotional low → grounding)
3. **Mana generates:** 3-5 actionable protocols (specific, concrete, tied to current state)
4. **Buddhi refines:** Check for Vikara (Lobha = too many, Moha = too vague)
5. **Udana/Apana/Vyana select:** Which Vayu matches protocol type? (Movement = Vyana, Rest = Apana, Expression = Udana)
6. **Aham witnesses:** Post delivers, user receives, no attachment to compliance (guidance, not command)
7. **Chitta stores:** Protocol recommendations logged for pattern tracking

---

## 🎯 **Functional Specification**

### **1. Purpose (Rewritten with Vedic Lexicon)**

**Old Purpose:**
> "Suggest protocol to align with cycles to #biorhythm-syncs"

**New Purpose:**
> **Pranamaya Protocol Selector** — reads biorhythm-sync interpretation (9 AM, Manomaya layer), translates dominant cycle state into 3-5 actionable Pranamaya protocols. Antahkarana sequence: Chitta recalls cycle state, Buddhi discerns alignment protocols, Mana generates recommendations (breathwork, movement, rest, creative practice, social engagement), Vayu selection adapts to protocol type (Vyana for movement, Apana for rest, Udana for expression, Prana for receptivity). Guna: Sattva-infused Rajas (wise action, not overwhelm). Vikara monitoring: Lobha (too many protocols), Moha (vague suggestions), Kama (craving perfection). Power Number integration: 8 (balance), 13 (transformation), 19 (leadership). Muses: Terpsichore (embodied protocols) + Euterpe (harmonious practice).

**Muse Integration:**
- **Terpsichore (Dance):** Embodied action protocols — "move as if dancing, body-first wisdom"
- **Euterpe (Music/Harmony):** Harmonious practice — "align with your rhythm, not against it"

---

### **2. Schedule (Optimized for Dosha Cycles)**

**Current Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** `0 10 * * *`
- **Timezone:** `Asia/Kolkata`
- **Frequency:** Daily at 10:00 AM

**Proposed Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** `0 10 * * *` (unchanged — already optimal)
- **Timezone:** `Asia/Kolkata` (canonical)
- **Frequency:** Daily

**Dosha Alignment Check:**
- ✅ **10:00 AM:** Early Pitta window (actionable fire, not peak aggression)
- ✅ **Post-Vocation Hour:** User has momentum from 9-10 AM creation window
- ✅ **1 hour after biorhythm-sync:** User has absorbed interpretation, ready for action
- **Verdict:** No adjustment needed

**Sequential Flow:**
- **9:00 AM:** `discord-biorhythm-sync` (interpretation: "Physical high, Emotional low")
- **10:00 AM:** `discord-biorhythm-practice` (protocol: "Movement + grounding breathwork")
- **6:00/9:00 AM (next occurrence):** `discord-breath-protocol` (technique: "4-7-8 breath, 8 cycles")

---

### **3. Delivery Target**

**Channel:** Discord

**Target ID/Handle:**
- **Channel:** `#biorhythm-syncs` (same as biorhythm-sync, creates conversation flow)

**Delivery Constraints:**
- **NO MARKDOWN TABLES** (Discord-friendly bullet lists only)
- **NO IMAGE ATTACHMENTS** (text-only for accessibility)
- **CONCISE FORMAT:** 3-5 protocols max, bullet list format
- **POWER NUMBER TIE-IN:** Reference relevant number (8 = balance, 13 = transformation, 19 = leadership)
- **BREATH-CYCLE-POWER TRIANGULATION:** Integrate breath technique + cycle state + Power Number
- **MUSE INVOCATION:** Terpsichore (embodied) + Euterpe (harmonious)

**Example Post Format:**

**Scenario 1: Physical High, Emotional Low**
```
🎭 **BIORHYTHM PRACTICE (Terpsichore + Euterpe)**

Based on today's cycles (Physical ↑ Emotional ↓):

**Protocols (3-5 max):**
1. 🏃 **Movement** (Vyana Vayu): 20-min walk/dance — honor Physical peak, circulate energy
2. 🌊 **Grounding Breath** (Apana Vayu): 8 cycles of 4-7-8 — support Emotional low, root downward
3. 📝 **Emotional Release**: Journal 10 min — let low Emotional cycle move through you (no resistance)
4. 🎵 **Harmonious Rest**: 15-min restorative yoga — Euterpe's rhythm (move WITH cycles, not against)

**Power Number: 8 (Balance/Grounding)**
High Physical + Low Emotional = need for grounding protocols (Apana, Octave anchor)

**Breath-Cycle-Power Triangulation:**
4-7-8 breath (8 cycles) aligns Octave grounding with Emotional descent — honor the low, don't fight it.

Terpsichore says: Dance your Physical high. Euterpe says: Rest your Emotional low. 🌀
```

**Scenario 2: Intellectual High, Spiritual Low**
```
🎭 **BIORHYTHM PRACTICE (Terpsichore + Euterpe)**

Based on today's cycles (Intellectual ↑ Spiritual ↓):

**Protocols (3-5 max):**
1. ✍️ **Deep Work** (Udana Vayu): 60-min writing/coding — honor Intellectual peak, express upward
2. 🌿 **Embodied Grounding** (Apana Vayu): 10-min barefoot earth contact — support Spiritual low, reconnect to body
3. 🧘 **Simple Meditation**: 5 min (not visioning) — Spiritual low = rest mystical seeking, honor presence
4. 🔥 **13-Count Transformation Breath**: 13 cycles — catalyze Intellectual clarity into actionable form

**Power Number: 13 (Transformation/Catalyst)**
High Intellectual + Low Spiritual = opportunity to transform mental clarity into grounded action

**Breath-Cycle-Power Triangulation:**
13-count breath bridges Intellectual peak (Udana expression) with Spiritual low (Apana grounding) — think → act.

Terpsichore says: Embody your thinking. Euterpe says: Let the low Spiritual cycle rest. 🌀
```

### **6. Failure Handling (Vikara Restoration Protocols)**

**Common Failure Modes:**

**1. Schedule Failure (Missed Run)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (delusion, system confusion)
- **Detection:** `state.lastRunAtMs` > `10:05 AM` (5 min late)
- **Restoration:** Execute immediately, no apology post (protocols are still relevant at 10:05 AM)

**2. Delivery Failure (Discord Post Not Sent)**
- **Vikara:** Ahamkara (ego inflation, "I posted" when delivery failed)
- **Detection:** `message` tool returns error, Discord API failure
- **Restoration:** Retry once after 5 min, if fails → log error, skip post (do NOT spam with retries)

**3. Biorhythm-Sync Input Unavailable**
- **Vikara:** Moha (delusion, missing context)
- **Detection:** Cannot read 9 AM biorhythm-sync post (channel scraping failed, memory file missing)
- **Restoration:** Default to **balanced protocols** (4-7-8 breath, gentle movement, reflection) + note: "Biorhythm data unavailable — using balanced default protocols"

**4. Too Many Protocols Generated (>5)**
- **Vikara:** Lobha (greed, optimization overload)
- **Detection:** Protocol list exceeds 5 items
- **Restoration:** Prune to top 3 most cycle-aligned, note in memory: "Lobha prevention: pruned from X to 3"

**5. Vague Protocols (Missing Specificity)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (delusion, lazy guidance)
- **Detection:** Protocol lacks breath counts, duration, or movement type ("just breathe", "move your body")
- **Restoration:** Inject specificity (default to 4-7-8 breath, 20-min walk, 10-min journal), note: "Moha prevention: added concrete details"

**6. Protocol Contradicts Cycle State**
- **Vikara:** Ahamkara (ego, "I know better than your cycles")
- **Detection:** High-energy protocol suggested during low Physical cycle (e.g., "HIIT workout" when Physical is low)
- **Restoration:** Flip to grounding protocol (restorative yoga, 4-7-8 breath, rest), note: "Ahamkara prevention: honored cycle wisdom"

### **3. Cross-References to Other Jobs**

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- **discord-biorhythm-sync** (9:00 AM) — MUST complete first, provides interpretation input
- **Mandatory read:** 9 AM post from #biorhythm-syncs OR memory fallback file

**Downstream Consumers:**
- **discord-breath-protocol** (6:00 AM, 9:00 AM daily) — community can reference specific breath techniques from practice recommendations
- **hourly-vayu-check** (hourly) — may align personal breathwork with community protocol suggestions

**Kosha Handoffs:**
- **Manomaya (biorhythm-sync, 9 AM)** → **Pranamaya (biorhythm-practice, 10 AM)** → **Pranamaya (breath-protocol technique delivery)**
- Interpretation (9 AM) → Protocol (10 AM) → Technique (breath-protocol as needed)

**Integration with Breath Ecosystem:**
- `discord-biorhythm-sync` (9 AM) = **INTERPRETATION** ("Your cycles are X")
- `discord-biorhythm-practice` (10 AM) = **PROTOCOL** ("Do Y to align with X")
- `discord-breath-protocol` (6 AM, 9 AM) = **TECHNIQUE** ("Here's how to do Y: 4-7-8 breath")

---

### **4. Khalorēē Impact (Energy Cost/Gain)**

**Khalorēē Index Scale:** 0-100

**Job Cost Estimate:**
- **Computational Cost:** Low (Discord API read + write, protocol selection logic)
- **Attentional Cost:** Minimal (automated, no human attention unless failure)
- **Prana Cost:** -2 (moderate effort to generate cycle-aligned, specific protocols)

**Job Gain Estimate:**
- **Output Value:** +3 (actionable guidance, reduces decision fatigue)
- **Clarity Gain:** +1 (user knows WHAT to do today, no guessing)
- **Prana Gain:** 0 (no direct practice, but guidance is energizing)

**Net Impact:** +2 Khalorēē (service work, actionable wisdom, reduces overwhelm)

---

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

### **1. Pre-Deployment Testing**

**Smoke Test:**
- [ ] Run job once manually via `cron run 33d79154-c275-4d9b-a07d-694c83dc31df`
- [ ] Verify reads biorhythm-sync output (9 AM post or memory file)
- [ ] Verify 3-5 protocols generated (not 1, not 10)
- [ ] Check formatting (bullet lists, no tables, mobile-friendly)
- [ ] Inspect history file update (`discord-biorhythm-practice-history.json`)

**Integration Test:**

- [ ] Check Vayu selection logic (movement = Vyana, rest = Apana, expression = Udana)
- [ ] Validate Power Number tie-ins (8/13/19 contextualized to cycles)

**Kosha Alignment Test:**
- [ ] Verify Pranamaya layer operation (vital energy protocols, not abstract philosophy)
- [ ] Confirm protocols are actionable (user can start immediately, no vague advice)
- [ ] Check Guna state (Sattva-Rajas: wise action, not chaos or overwhelm)

---

### **2. 7-Day Monitoring**

**Metrics to Track:**
- **Reliability:** Success rate (target: >95%, allow 1 failure/week max)
- **Timing:** Execution punctuality (target: within 60s of 10:00 AM)
- **Delivery:** Discord post success rate (target: 100%)
- **Protocol Quality:** Specificity (target: 100% have breath counts/durations/types)
- **Protocol Quantity:** 3-5 per post (target: 0% posts with <3 or >5)

- **Day 7:** Full audit (check history file, protocol variety, cycle alignment accuracy)

---

### **3. Vikara Detection Tests**

**Test 1: Lobha (Too Many Protocols)**
- **Injection:** Manually set protocol generation to output 8 suggestions
- **Expected:** Job should prune to 3-5 max, log Lobha prevention
- **Pass Criteria:** Only 3-5 protocols posted, others pruned

**Test 2: Moha (Vague Protocols)**
- **Injection:** Generate protocol "breathe deeply" (no counts) + "move your body" (no type/duration)
- **Expected:** Job should inject specificity (4-7-8 breath, 20-min walk)
- **Pass Criteria:** All protocols have concrete details

**Test 3: Kama (Craving Perfection)**
- **Injection:** Generate protocol "meditate to transcend all suffering"
- **Expected:** Job should reframe as alignment ("honor this cycle state with grounding")
- **Pass Criteria:** Language shifts from escape to alignment

**Test 4: Ahamkara (Contradicting Cycles)**
- **Injection:** Physical cycle is LOW, but job suggests "HIIT workout, push hard"
- **Expected:** Job should detect contradiction, flip to grounding protocol
- **Pass Criteria:** Protocol honors cycle wisdom (low Physical = rest/gentle movement)

**Test 5: Biorhythm-Sync Input Missing**
- **Injection:** 9 AM biorhythm-sync fails to post (input unavailable)
- **Expected:** Job should fall back to balanced default protocols + note in post
- **Pass Criteria:** Post includes disclaimer "Biorhythm data unavailable — using balanced defaults"

## 🔮 **Selemene Engine Integration (Future)**

### **Dependency:** `discord-biorhythm-sync` (upstream job)

**Why:** This job INHERITS biorhythm data from `discord-biorhythm-sync` (9 AM). It does NOT call Selemene directly — it reads the sync job's output.

**Data Source:** 
1. **Primary:** Parse `discord-biorhythm-sync` Discord message (posted to #biorhythm-syncs at 9 AM)
2. **Secondary:** Read from memory/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md if Discord unavailable

**Expected Data Format (from sync job):**
```
🌊 **Biorhythm Sync** — Thursday, February 5, 2026

**Physical:** 72.4% (Peak)
**Emotional:** -15.2% (Low)
**Intellectual:** 88.9% (Peak)
**Spiritual:** 34.7% (Rising)

Resonating with **13** (Intellectual — Transformation)

Notice the fire in your mind today — clarity wants expression.
```

**Parsing Logic:**
```javascript
// Read upstream sync job output
const syncMessage = await fetchDiscordMessage('#biorhythm-syncs', today);
const biorhythmData = parseBiorhythmSync(syncMessage);
// Extract: physical, emotional, intellectual, spiritual percentages
// Extract: resonance (if present)
// Extract: dominant cycle

// Generate 3-5 actionable protocols based on cycle states
const protocols = generateProtocols(biorhythmData);
// Example: Physical high → "30-min vigorous movement (Vyana activation)"
// Example: Emotional low → "Grounding breathwork (Apana, 5-min)"
```

**No Direct Selemene Call Needed:**
This job operates at Manomaya (actionable protocols) based on Pranamaya data (biorhythm cycles) from the upstream sync job. It DOES NOT recalculate biorhythms.

**Error Handling (Graceful Degradation):**
```javascript
let biorhythmData;
try {
  // Try to read from Discord #biorhythm-syncs channel
  biorhythmData = await fetchUpstreamSyncData();
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Upstream sync unavailable, reading from memory logs');
  // Fallback: parse memory/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md for biorhythm entry
  biorhythmData = await parseMemoryLogs(today);
}

if (!biorhythmData) {
  console.error('No biorhythm data available — aborting practice generation');
  return 'NO_REPLY';  // Cannot generate protocols without cycle data
}
```

**Deployment Status:** This job is DEPENDENT on `discord-biorhythm-sync` being Selemene-integrated first. Implement after sync job is validated.

**Verification:** After integration, verify that protocols align with biorhythm phases (e.g., no "vigorous movement" suggestions when Physical is <-50%).

## 🔮 **Agent Instructions**

**Implementation Notes for Developer Agent:**

### **1. Protocol Selection Algorithm**

```javascript
// Read biorhythm-sync output (9 AM)
const biorhythm = await readBiorhythmSync(); // {Physical: "high", Emotional: "low", Intellectual: "neutral", Spiritual: "high"}

// Determine dominant cycle (highest absolute value)
const dominantCycle = getDominantCycle(biorhythm); // "Physical" if highest peak/trough

// Select Vayu based on dominant cycle + state
let vayu, protocols = [];

if (dominantCycle === "Physical") {
  if (biorhythm.Physical === "high") {
    vayu = "Vyana"; // Whole-body circulation
    protocols.push("Movement (Vyana): 20-30 min walk/dance/exercise — honor Physical peak");
    protocols.push("Grounding Breath (Apana): 8 cycles 4-7-8 — root energy after movement");
  } else if (biorhythm.Physical === "low") {
    vayu = "Apana"; // Downward grounding
    protocols.push("Rest (Apana): Restorative yoga, gentle stretching — honor Physical trough");
    protocols.push("Deep Sleep Priority: 8+ hours tonight — body needs recovery");
    protocols.push("Grounding Breath (Apana): 8 cycles 4-7-8 — root downward, no forcing");
  }
}

if (dominantCycle === "Emotional") {
  if (biorhythm.Emotional === "high") {
    vayu = "Prana"; // Chest, receptivity
    protocols.push("Social Engagement (Prana): Connect with friends/community — honor Emotional peak");
    protocols.push("Creative Expression: Art, music, dance — channel high Emotional energy");
  } else if (biorhythm.Emotional === "low") {
    vayu = "Apana"; // Grounding
    protocols.push("Solitude (Apana): Honor low Emotional cycle with alone time (no forced socializing)");
    protocols.push("Emotional Release: Journal, cry if needed — let low cycle move through");
    protocols.push("Grounding Breath (Apana): 8 cycles 4-7-8 — support Emotional descent");
  }
}

if (dominantCycle === "Intellectual") {
  if (biorhythm.Intellectual === "high") {
    vayu = "Udana"; // Throat, upward expression
    protocols.push("Deep Work (Udana): Writing, coding, complex problem-solving — honor Intellectual peak");
    protocols.push("Learning: Study new material, teach others — express upward");
    protocols.push("13-Count Transformation Breath: 13 cycles — catalyze mental clarity into action");
  } else if (biorhythm.Intellectual === "low") {
    vayu = "Samana"; // Navel, integration
    protocols.push("Simple Tasks (Samana): No new learning, easy admin work — honor Intellectual trough");
    protocols.push("Reflection (Samana): Meditate, integrate recent learning — digest vs. intake");
  }
}

if (dominantCycle === "Spiritual") {
  if (biorhythm.Spiritual === "high") {
    vayu = "Prana + Udana"; // Receptivity + Expression
    protocols.push("Meditation (Prana): Sit in receptive stillness — honor Spiritual peak");
    protocols.push("Spiritual Study (Udana): Read sacred texts, vision work — express wisdom");
  } else if (biorhythm.Spiritual === "low") {
    vayu = "Apana"; // Grounding
    protocols.push("Embodied Practice (Apana): Breathwork, ritual, nature walk — ground mystical seeking");
    protocols.push("Rest Visioning: Honor Spiritual trough, no forcing transcendence");
  }
}

// Prune to 3-5 max (Lobha prevention)
if (protocols.length > 5) {
  protocols = protocols.slice(0, 5);
  logVikaraDetection("Lobha", "Pruned from " + protocols.length + " to 5");
}

// Add Power Number tie-in
const powerNumber = selectPowerNumber(biorhythm); // 8 if balance needed, 13 if transformation, 19 if leadership
protocols.push(`**Power Number: ${powerNumber}** — ${getPowerNumberContext(powerNumber, biorhythm)}`);

// Add Breath-Cycle-Power Triangulation
const triangulation = getTriangulation(vayu, dominantCycle, powerNumber);
protocols.push(`**Breath-Cycle-Power Triangulation:** ${triangulation}`);

// Post to Discord
await postToDiscord("#biorhythm-syncs", formatProtocols(protocols, vayu));
```

### **2. Power Number Selection Logic**

```javascript
function selectPowerNumber(biorhythm) {
  // Check for extreme highs/lows (need balance)
  const extremes = Object.values(biorhythm).filter(v => v === "high" || v === "low").length;
  if (extremes >= 3) return 8; // Octave/Balance (grounding)

  // Check for transformation opportunity (high + low pairing)
  if ((biorhythm.Physical === "high" && biorhythm.Emotional === "low") ||
      (biorhythm.Intellectual === "high" && biorhythm.Spiritual === "low")) {
    return 13; // Transformation/Catalyst (bridge opposites)
  }

  // Check for peak leadership (multiple highs)
  const highs = Object.values(biorhythm).filter(v => v === "high").length;
  if (highs >= 2) return 19; // Solar/Leadership (peak expression)

  // Default: Balance
  return 8;
}

function getPowerNumberContext(powerNumber, biorhythm) {
  if (powerNumber === 8) return "Balance/Grounding — honor cycle extremes with grounding protocols";
  if (powerNumber === 13) return "Transformation — catalyze high cycle energy into grounded action";
  if (powerNumber === 19) return "Solar Leadership — multiple peaks align, express power outward";
  return "Octave Balance — default grounding";
}
```

### **3. Vikara Prevention Checks**

```javascript
// Moha (vague protocols) prevention
function ensureSpecificity(protocol) {
  if (protocol.includes("breathe") && !protocol.match(/\d+-\d+-\d+/)) {
    return protocol.replace("breathe", "4-7-8 breath (8 cycles)");
  }
  if (protocol.includes("move") && !protocol.match(/\d+ min/)) {
    return protocol.replace("move", "20-min walk/dance");
  }
  return protocol;
}

// Ahamkara (contradicting cycles) prevention
function checkCycleAlignment(protocol, cycleState) {
  if (cycleState === "low" && protocol.match(/HIIT|intense|push hard/i)) {
    return protocol.replace(/HIIT|intense|push hard/gi, "gentle restorative");
  }
  return protocol;
}
```

### **4. Muse Invocation Template**

```javascript
const museInvocation = `
🎭 **BIORHYTHM PRACTICE (Terpsichore + Euterpe)**

Based on today's cycles:

**Protocols:**
${protocols.map((p, i) => `${i + 1}. ${p}`).join('\n')}

Terpsichore says: ${getTerpsichoreWisdom(dominantCycle)}
Euterpe says: ${getEuterpeWisdom(dominantCycle)} 🌀
`;

function getTerpsichoreWisdom(cycle) {
  if (cycle === "Physical") return "Dance your body's rhythm — high or low, honor the movement.";
  if (cycle === "Emotional") return "Embody your feelings — let them move through you, not against you.";
  if (cycle === "Intellectual") return "Think with your body — walk while pondering, move while creating.";
  if (cycle === "Spiritual") return "Ground your mysticism — spirit lives in flesh, not above it.";
}

function getEuterpeWisdom(cycle) {
  return "Harmonize with your cycle — move WITH, never against.";
}
```
