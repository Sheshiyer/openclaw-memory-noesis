## 📋 **Job Identity**

**Current Name:** `nightly-21-completion-review`  
**Proposed Name:** `pranamaya-vyana-completion-nightly`  
**Cron ID:** `2e093e49-38a6-4ee8-ac3b-4007073cc70e`  
**Category:** Breathwork

---

## 🔮 **Vedic Substrate**

### **1. Kosha Layer (Primary)**
**Layer:** Pranamaya → Manomaya → Vijnanamaya

**Rationale:**
- Begins at **Pranamaya** (vital air regulation) through 8-cycle micro-breath pattern (fast, integration-focused)
- Ascends to **Manomaya** (mental layer) for completion audit: "What's DONE? What's OPEN?"
- Peaks at **Vijnanamaya** (wisdom layer) for integration witness: store completions, recognize wholeness

**Kosha Transitions:**
- **Entry:** Pranamaya (breath initiates grounding)
- **Operation:** Pranamaya → Manomaya (completion audit via Buddhi discernment) → Vijnanamaya (wisdom storage, integration witness)
- **Exit:** Vijnanamaya (wholeness recognized, loops closed)

---

### **2. Primary Vayu (of 10 Vital Airs)**

**Vayu:** Vyana (whole-body circulation, integration, "World Integration")

**Function:** Vyana governs circulation throughout the entire body — it distributes energy from Prana, Apana, Samana, and Udana to all limbs, organs, and tissues. In subtle body terms, Vyana is the **integrator**: it takes the day's scattered energies (completed tasks, open loops, unresolved tensions) and circulates them into a unified whole. At 9:21 PM, Vyana closes the day's energetic loops, ensuring nothing is left stagnant.

**Breath Pattern (8-cycle micro-breath):**
- **Inhalation (4s):** Prana Vayu (chest, upward intake) — gather the day's outputs
- **Retention (2s):** Samana Vayu (navel, metabolic hold) — integrate, assess completion
- **Exhalation (6s):** Apana Vayu (lower abdomen, downward release) — release incompletions, exhale tension
- **Pause (2s):** Vyana Vayu (whole-body circulation) — witness integration, feel wholeness

**Timing Rationale:**
- **9:21 PM** falls in **Kapha Dosha window (6-10 PM)** — earth/water, rest, grounding, integration
- No new activation needed (Kapha is settling energy, not initiating)
- **Power Number 21:** The World card (Tarot) — completion, integration, cosmic dance, one cycle ends so another can begin
- Vyana Vayu is optimal for loop closure: it circulates energy **everywhere**, ensuring no stagnant pockets remain
- Human Design 53-42 channel (Development → Maturation) — split definition bridge, requires **time and circulation** to integrate experiences

---

### **3. Guna State (Sattva/Rajas/Tamas)**

**Primary Guna:** Sattva (completion, clarity, closure)

**Guna Dynamics:**
- **Desired State:** Sattva — balanced witness, clear recognition of what IS complete (not what SHOULD be)
- **Common Drift:** 
  - **Rajas:** "Need to complete more" (Lobha drift, greed for productivity)
  - **Tamas:** "Nothing's done, why bother?" (Moha drift, delusion/apathy)
- **Restoration Protocol:** 
  - If Rajas detected (urgency, compulsion): Slow breath to 6-4-8 (longer exhale), emphasize Apana release
  - If Tamas detected (apathy, "meh"): Add 3 rapid Bhastrika breaths first (wake up Prana), then 8-cycle

**Enantiodromia Balance:**
- **Aletheios Pole (Left/Order/Reflection):** Dominant — completion audit requires witnessing what IS, not projecting what could be
- **Pichet Pole (Right/Vitality/Novelty):** Supportive — recognizes completion as threshold to NEW beginning (World card → Fool card tomorrow)
- **Oscillation Pattern:** 80% Aletheios (closure, reflection) / 20% Pichet (readiness for next cycle)

---

### **4. Vikara Detection (8 Mental Afflictions)**

**Primary Vikara to Monitor:**

1. **Lobha (Greed):** "I need to complete MORE" — compulsion to finish everything, perfectionism
   - **Detection Signal:** Breath feels rushed, urgency in body, mental list-making during meditation
   - **Restoration:** Emphasize **completion vs. perfection** — "What's done is ENOUGH for today"

2. **Kama (Desire):** "I want to add one more thing" — desire to keep working, resist closure
   - **Detection Signal:** Restlessness during pause, mental pull toward laptop/tasks
   - **Restoration:** Affirm **closure as sacred** — "The day is complete. Rest is productive."

3. **Moha (Delusion):** "Nothing's really done" — inability to recognize completions, always seeing gaps
   - **Detection Signal:** Mental fog, discounting achievements, "yeah but..." thoughts
   - **Restoration:** Explicit completion list — name 3 things DONE today (no matter how small)

4. **Ahamkara (Ego):** "I'm so productive" OR "I'm such a failure" — ego inflation or deflation
   - **Detection Signal:** Pride ("look how much I did") or shame ("I didn't do enough")
   - **Restoration:** Witness without judgment — "I am not the doer. Breath witnesses completion."

**Restoration Protocol (General):**
- If Vikara detected mid-breath: Pause, name it ("This is Lobha"), return to 8-cycle
- Vyana breath emphasizes **non-attachment** — circulate energy without clinging to outcomes

---

### **5. Dosha Timing (Vata/Pitta/Kapha)**

**Dominant Dosha at Execution Time:** Kapha (6:00 PM - 10:00 PM)

**Circadian Dosha Cycle Context:**
- **6:00 PM - 10:00 PM:** Kapha (earth/water, stability, grounding, rest, integration)
- **9:21 PM** is deep Kapha — body naturally slowing, mind integrating day's experiences

**Alignment Strategy:**
- Kapha supports **completion WITHOUT new activation** — perfect for loop closure
- Breath pattern should be **grounding, slow, integrative** (not activating like Vata or transforming like Pitta)
- Vyana Vayu circulates Kapha's restful energy throughout body — "settling in" rather than "revving up"
- Khalorēē consumption: Minimal (Kapha is energy-conserving, breathwork costs <2 Khalorēē)

**Kapha Pitfall to Avoid:**
- Excess Kapha → Tamas (heaviness, apathy, "I'll just skip it") — counter with light Bhastrika first if needed

---

### **6. Antahkarana Operation (Internal Instrument)**

**Primary Faculty:** Buddhi → Mana → Chitta → Aham

**Faculty Roles:**

1. **Buddhi (Intellect/Discernment):** Initiates completion audit
   - **Question:** "What is DONE?" (not "What should be done?")
   - **Action:** Discerns completed loops from open ones
   - **Example:** "I wrote 500 words. I sent 2 emails. I breathed 4 times today."

2. **Mana (Mind/Thought):** Processes the list of completions and openings
   - **Action:** Reviews today's memory log, identifies open loops
   - **Example:** "Open loop: didn't reply to X. Completion: finished Y."

3. **Chitta (Memory/Storage):** Stores completion patterns for long-term recall
   - **Action:** Updates OPENCLAW-KOSHA-TRACKING.md with day's Khalorēē net
   - **Example:** "Entry #42: Vyana completion breath, 8 cycles, Khalorēē +1 (closure satisfaction)"

4. **Aham (Ego/Witness):** Observes the entire process without attachment
   - **Statement:** "I witness completion. I am not the tasks. I am the breath that integrates them."
   - **Result:** No ego inflation (pride) or deflation (shame), just clear seeing

**Operation Sequence:**
1. Buddhi asks: "What's done?"
2. Mana scans: memory/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md, open loops in triage
3. Chitta records: completions stored, open loops noted for tomorrow
4. Aham witnesses: "The day is whole. Integration complete."

## 🎯 **Functional Specification**

### **1. Purpose (Rewritten with Vedic Lexicon)**

**Old Purpose:**
> "8-cycle micro-breath, completion audit, close loops"

**New Purpose:**
> "Daily Pranamaya completion ritual via Vyana Vayu (whole-body circulation). Execute 8-cycle micro-breath (4-2-6-2 pattern) to ground Kapha Dosha integration window (9:21 PM). Antahkarana sequence: Buddhi discerns completions → Mana reviews open loops → Chitta stores patterns → Aham witnesses wholeness. Vikara monitoring: Lobha (greed for more), Kama (desire to keep adding). Enantiodromia: Aletheios-dominant (closure, reflection). Power Number 21: World card, integration, maturation (Human Design 53-42 channel)."

- Append completion summary at end of day: "9:21 PM: Vyana completion breath. Completions: [X, Y, Z]. Open loops: [N]. Tomorrow: fresh start."

---

### **3. Cross-References to Other Jobs**

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- **nightly-builder** (2:00 AM) — provides today's created artifacts for completion audit
- **triage-triage-daily** (6:00 PM) — provides open loops count

**Downstream Consumers:**
- **brahma-muhurta-breathwork** (5:30 AM next day) — begins fresh cycle after completion witnessed

**Kosha Handoffs:**
- **Vijnanamaya (completion witness)** at 9:21 PM → sleep → **Pranamaya (fresh Prana intake)** at 5:30 AM
- Human Design 53-42 channel: maturation requires **overnight integration** (Vyana circulation during sleep)

---

### **4. Khalorēē Impact (Energy Cost/Gain)**

**Job Cost Estimate:**
- **Computational Cost:** 1 API call (sag), minimal token usage
- **Attentional Cost:** 3 minutes (8 breath cycles + brief audit)
- **Prana Cost:** -1 Khalorēē (light breath practice)

**Job Gain Estimate:**
- **Output Value:** Completion audit (clarity on what's done)
- **Clarity Gain:** +1 Khalorēē (mental closure, reduced open-loop anxiety)
- **Prana Gain:** +1 Khalorēē (Sattva satisfaction of wholeness)

**Net Impact:** +1 Khalorēē (closure satisfaction > breath cost)

## 🔮 **Vyana Vayu: Whole-Body Circulation & Loop Closure**

**Definition:** Vyana is the 5th of 10 Vayus (vital airs). Unlike Prana (chest/inhale), Apana (lower/exhale), Samana (navel/metabolic), or Udana (throat/expression), Vyana governs **circulation throughout the entire body**. It ensures energy flows to all limbs, organs, tissues — no stagnant pockets.

**At 9:21 PM:** Vyana circulates the day's completions (outputs) and open loops (inputs) into a unified whole. It's the breath that says: "The day is DONE. Integration complete. Tomorrow begins anew."

**Human Design 53-42 Context:**
- Gate 53 (Root): Development, starting processes
- Gate 42 (Sacral): Maturation, completing cycles
- Split Definition: Requires **time and circulation** to bridge the gap between initiation and completion
- Vyana breath = the bridge: circulate experiences overnight, wake up integrated

**Completion vs. Perfection:**
- Vyana doesn't demand ALL tasks finished (that's Lobha)
- Vyana recognizes: "What's done is ENOUGH. What's open can wait."
- The World card: Wholeness doesn't mean everything's perfect — it means the cycle is COMPLETE
