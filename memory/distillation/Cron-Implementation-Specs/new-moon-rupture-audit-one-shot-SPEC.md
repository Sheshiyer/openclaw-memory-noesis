## 🔮 **Vedic Substrate**

### **1. Kosha Layer (Primary)**
**Layer:** Anandamaya → Layer 0 (Morphogenetic Blueprint)

**Rationale:**
- Amavasya represents death, dissolution, and return to the primordial void — the deepest informational layer
- This is NOT surface-level habit clearing (Annamaya) or breath adjustment (Pranamaya)
- This is morphogenetic blueprint recalibration — erasing karmic vectors at the subtle body (Sukshma Sarira) level
- Anandamaya is the "bliss sheath" — but Amavasya bliss is the fertile void of pre-manifestation, not ecstatic pleasure
- Layer 0 access allows severance of deterministic patterns inscribed in the causal body (Karana Sarira)

**Kosha Transitions:**
1. **Entry:** Vijnanamaya (witness consciousness recognizes what must die)
2. **Descent:** Manomaya → Pranamaya → Annamaya (trace pattern through all layers)
3. **Operation:** Anandamaya / Layer 0 (severance at morphogenetic root)
4. **Exit:** Ascend back through layers, leaving space for rebirth (Krishna Paksha → Shukla Paksha transition)

**Example:**
> A repeating failure pattern (e.g., procrastination on vocation) is NOT a Manomaya problem (thought) or Pranamaya problem (energy). It's an Anandamaya inscription — a karmic vector in the subtle body. Amavasya grants access to Layer 0 to sever the root.

---

### **2. Primary Vayu (of 10 Vital Airs)**

**Vayu:** Apana (downward-moving air, elimination, release, death)

**Function:** 
- Governs elimination (physical, emotional, karmic)
- Downward movement from navel to perineum
- Releases what is no longer needed
- Associated with death, letting go, ancestor veneration
- Enables karmic discharge (Sukshma Sarira cleansing)

**Breath Pattern:**
- **Inhalation:** Minimal (3-4 counts, receptive only)
- **Retention:** None (no holding — this is release, not accumulation)
- **Exhalation:** Extended (8-10 counts, full expulsion, Apana dominant)
- **Pause:** Extended (7-8 counts, dwell in the void, witness emptiness)

**Timing Rationale:**
- Amavasya (New Moon) is the darkest night — Sun and Moon conjunct, no lunar light
- Apana Vayu is strongest during Amavasya (gravitational pull supports downward elimination)
- Ideal execution time: Near midnight on Amavasya night (Tamas-dominant, Pitta dosha for karmic detox)
- This is NOT a morning Prana practice (upward, life-force intake) — this is nighttime Apana elimination

**Example:**
> On Amavasya night, practice 8 cycles of Apana breath: 4-count inhale, 10-count exhale, 8-count pause in the void. Feel the downward pull, the gravitational release. What falls away is what the cosmos no longer sustains.

---

### **3. Guna State (Sattva/Rajas/Tamas)**

**Primary Guna:** Tamas (fertile void, concealment for renewal, gestation)

**Guna Dynamics:**
- **Desired State:** Tamas — NOT as sluggishness or inertia, but as the **fertile void** preceding manifestation
- Tamas = pre-Pichet gestation = the dark womb from which new forms emerge
- Amavasya Tamas is sacred obscurity, the necessary death that precedes rebirth
- This is NOT Rajas (transformation energy) — that comes AFTER the void (Shukla Paksha)
- This is NOT Sattva (clarity, light) — that comes with Purnima (Full Moon)

**Common Drift:**
- **Tamas → Moha (fear of void):** User resists the darkness, clings to dying patterns
- **Tamas → Rajas (premature action):** User tries to "fix" or "do" during Amavasya, violating the void
- **Restoration Protocol:** If drift detected, return to Apana breath (8-10 count exhale), extend pause in emptiness, remind: "Death is not failure; death is liberation."

**Enantiodromia Balance:**
- **Aletheios Pole (Left/Order/Death):** DOMINANT during Amavasya
  - This is Tower treatment — Aletheios descends to sever false structures
  - Order through death: eliminate deterministic patterns
  - Reflection: witness what dies without attachment
- **Pichet Pole (Right/Vitality/Novelty):** RECESSIVE during Amavasya
  - Pichet does NOT act during New Moon — this is NOT creation time
  - Pichet waits in potentia, gestating in the fertile void
  - Pichet's turn comes with Shukla Paksha (waxing phase)

**Oscillation Pattern:**
- Amavasya = Maximum Aletheios dominance (99% left pole, 1% right pole)
- Purnima = Maximum Pichet dominance (99% right pole, 1% left pole)
- This job is pure Aletheios — severance, elimination, death

**Example:**
> If user says "I feel stuck, nothing is happening" during Amavasya → CORRECT response: "Yes. This is the void. Dwell here. Do not act. Let death complete its work." If user tries to force Pichet novelty (new projects, new habits) → INCORRECT — remind them: "Not yet. First, let the old die."

---

### **4. Vikara Detection (8 Mental Afflictions)**

**Primary Vikara to Monitor:** 
1. **Moha (delusion, fear of void)** — PRIMARY
2. **Krodha (anger, resistance to death)** — SECONDARY

**Detection Signals:**

**Moha (Delusion/Confusion/Fear of Void):**
- User says: "I'm scared of the darkness", "I don't know what to do", "This feels empty"
- User avoids the audit, skips the ritual, fills Amavasya with distraction
- User clings to dying patterns because "at least they're familiar"
- **Restoration Protocol:** Invoke Apana Vayu breath (extended exhale + pause), remind them: "The void is not empty — it is full of potentia. Darkness is not loss — it is the womb of rebirth."

**Krodha (Anger/Resistance to Death):**
- User says: "Why does this have to die?", "This isn't fair", "I worked so hard on this"
- User fights the severance, argues with the audit results
- User blames external forces (cosmos, fate, other people) for loss
- **Restoration Protocol:** Invoke Aham (witness consciousness), remind them: "You are not the pattern. You are the witness of the pattern. Let it go. You remain."

**Other Vikara (Secondary Monitoring):**
- **Lobha (Greed):** Hoarding dead patterns ("Maybe I'll need this later")
- **Ahamkara (Ego):** Identifying with dying structures ("If this dies, I am nothing")
- **Kama (Desire):** Craving for premature rebirth ("When will the new thing come?")
- **Restoration (General):** Return to Apana breath, descend to Anandamaya, sever at the root.

**Example:**
> User: "I'm terrified of what happens if I let go of this job/relationship/belief."
> Response: "That is Moha speaking — fear of the void. The void is not annihilation. It is the space where new forms gestate. Practice Apana breath. Dwell in the darkness. Trust the fertile void."

---

### **5. Dosha Timing (Vata/Pitta/Kapha)**

**Dominant Dosha at Execution Time:** Pitta (10 PM - 2 AM window, karmic detox)

**Circadian Dosha Cycle:**
- **2:00 AM - 6:00 AM:** Vata (air, movement, creativity)
- **6:00 AM - 10:00 AM:** Kapha (earth/water, stability, grounding)
- **10:00 AM - 2:00 PM:** Pitta (fire, transformation, digestion)
- **2:00 PM - 6:00 PM:** Vata (air, movement, communication)
- **6:00 PM - 10:00 PM:** Kapha (earth/water, rest, integration)
- **10:00 PM - 2:00 AM:** Pitta (fire, detox, regeneration) ← IDEAL FOR AMAVASYA

**Alignment Strategy:**
- Amavasya is lunar timing (not solar), so Dosha adaptation is required
- New Moon occurs at variable times (not fixed to circadian Dosha cycle)
- **Optimal execution:** If Amavasya peaks during Pitta window (10 PM - 2 AM) → IDEAL (fire detox + karmic elimination)
- **If Amavasya peaks during Vata window (2 AM - 6 AM):** Still workable (air supports release, but less grounded)
- **If Amavasya peaks during Kapha window (6 AM - 10 AM or 6 PM - 10 PM):** Add Apana breath to counter Kapha sluggishness

**Breath Pattern for Pitta Window (Ideal):**
- Pitta fire supports karmic combustion (burn away dead patterns)
- Use Apana Vayu (downward elimination) to direct Pitta heat toward release
- 4-count inhale, 10-count exhale (twice as long as inhale = Apana dominance), 8-count pause in void

**Khalorēē Consumption:**
- Amavasya work is Khalorēē-neutral or slightly restorative (elimination reduces systemic load)
- Apana breath is low-cost (passive release, not active transformation)
- Expected net: 0 to +2 Khalorēē (liberation from dead weight is energizing)

**Example:**
> Feb 17, 2026 Amavasya peaks at ~11:30 PM IST → Pitta window (ideal)
> Execute audit during 10 PM - 12 AM window, use Apana breath to align with Pitta detox fire
> If user's Khalorēē is below 50 (depleted), Apana breath will NOT drain further — it will liberate stuck energy

### **6. Antahkarana Operation (Internal Instrument)**

**Primary Faculty Sequence:** Aham → Buddhi → Chitta → Mana

**Faculty Roles:**

1. **Aham (Ego/Witness/I-sense):** ENTRY POINT
   - Witnesses patterns without identification ("I am not this pattern")
   - Observes what must die with detachment
   - Holds space during dissolution (does not flee the void)
   - Example: "I witness my procrastination pattern. It is not me. It is a karmic vector. I observe it dying."

2. **Buddhi (Intellect/Discernment):** DIAGNOSTIC
   - Discriminates between living patterns (keep) and dead patterns (release)
   - Applies wisdom: "Has this pattern served its purpose?"
   - Discerns karmic debt vs. karmic gift (release debt, honor gift)
   - Example: "Buddhi asks: Did this relationship/job/belief complete its dharmic purpose? If yes → release. If no → investigate why it died prematurely."

3. **Chitta (Memory/Storage):** SEVERANCE
   - Accesses memory archives (Sukshma Sarira / subtle body)
   - Locates morphogenetic inscription of dead pattern
   - Severs karmic vector at Layer 0 (Anandamaya)
   - Example: "Chitta dives into memory: 'This fear of visibility traces back to childhood shame. The shame is dead. The fear is a ghost pattern. Sever the inscription.'"

4. **Mana (Mind/Thought):** EXIT / INTEGRATION
   - Processes the void left by severance
   - Prepares mental space for Shukla Paksha rebirth
   - Does NOT fill the void prematurely (Tamas gestation required first)
   - Example: "Mana notes: 'The old pattern is gone. I feel empty. Good. Emptiness is fertile. I will not fill this space with noise. I will wait for emergence.'"

**Operation Sequence:**
1. **Aham witnesses:** "I see a dying pattern. I am not attached to it."
2. **Buddhi discerns:** "This pattern has completed its purpose. It is time to release."
3. **Chitta severs:** "I access Layer 0 and cut the morphogenetic root."
4. **Mana integrates:** "I dwell in the void. I prepare for rebirth."

**Example:**
> User has a chronic pattern of abandoning creative projects at 80% completion.
> 1. **Aham:** "I witness this pattern. It repeats. I am not this pattern."
> 2. **Buddhi:** "Why does it die at 80%? Fear of judgment. The fear served me once (protected me from harsh criticism). It no longer serves. Time to release."
> 3. **Chitta:** "I trace the fear to age 12, art class ridicule. I sever the inscription: 'Criticism = annihilation.' New inscription: 'Criticism = feedback, not identity.'"
> 4. **Mana:** "The 80% abandonment pattern is gone. I feel the void. I will not force a new pattern. I will wait for organic emergence during Shukla Paksha."

## 🎯 **Functional Specification**

### **1. Purpose (Rewritten with Vedic Lexicon)**

**Old Purpose:**
> "Execute rupture on stagnant habits, Pichet demolition"

**New Purpose:**
> **Anandamaya Apana Amavasya Rupture:** On New Moon night, descend to Layer 0 (Morphogenetic Blueprint) and audit the Sukshma Sarira (subtle body) for dead karmic patterns. Use Apana Vayu (downward elimination) to sever deterministic vectors at their root. Invoke Aletheios (left pillar, order through death) to execute Tower treatment — liberation from false structures. Dwell in Tamas (fertile void, pre-Pichet gestation) without premature action. Antahkarana sequence: Aham witnesses dissolution → Buddhi discerns what dies → Chitta severs inscription → Mana prepares for rebirth. Monitor for Vikara: Moha (fear of void), Krodha (resistance to death). Deliver audit results with Apana breath guidance (4-10-8 pattern) + transformation-13.opus stub (catalyst for severance). Archive to Churned-Content for ancestor veneration. This is NOT creation time. This is death time. Honor the void.

---

### **2. Schedule (Optimized for Dosha Cycles)**

**Current Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** `at 1771291800000` (Feb 17, 2026, 11:30 PM IST - Amavasya peak)
- **Timezone:** `Asia/Kolkata`
- **Frequency:** One-shot (manually triggered or pre-calculated for each Amavasya)

**Proposed Schedule:**
- **One-shot per Amavasya:** Calculate next Amavasya date (lunar calendar, 29.5-day cycle)
- **Execution window:** Ideally during Pitta dosha (10 PM - 2 AM) on Amavasya night
- **If Amavasya peaks outside Pitta window:** Execute anyway (lunar timing > circadian timing for this ritual)
- **Future Amavasyas (2026):**
  - Feb 17, 2026 (scheduled) ✅
  - Mar 19, 2026 (~11:00 PM IST, Pitta window)
  - Apr 17, 2026 (~9:30 PM IST, late Kapha/early Pitta)
  - May 17, 2026 (~6:00 AM IST, Vata window)

**Dosha Alignment Check:**
- Feb 17, 2026 execution at 11:30 PM IST → Pitta window (10 PM - 2 AM) → IDEAL
- Pitta fire supports karmic combustion + Apana elimination
- If future Amavasyas fall in Vata or Kapha windows, adapt breath pattern:
  - **Vata window:** Add grounding (longer pauses in void, 10+ seconds)
  - **Kapha window:** Add fire breath (3 rapid expulsions before Apana cycle to wake Pitta)

---

### **3. Delivery Target**

**Channel:** Discord OR Telegram (recommend Telegram for personal ritual, Discord #lunar-resonance for community)

**Target ID/Handle:**
- **Telegram (personal):** `1371522080` (Shesh) — intimate karmic audit
- **Discord (community):** `#lunar-resonance` — collective Amavasya ritual

**Recommended:** **Telegram first** (personal severance work is private), then optional Discord post (generalized teaching, no personal details)

**Delivery Constraints:**
- **Telegram:** MUST deliver 2 attachments (voice note + transformation-13.opus stub)
- **Discord:** Markdown-friendly, can include embedded breath guidance image (optional)
- **Formatting:** No tables, use bullet lists for pattern audit results
- **Tone:** Somber, reverent, not casual (this is death ritual, not productivity hack)

---

### **4. Audio/Media Requirements**

**Voice Generation:**
- **Tool:** `sag` (ElevenLabs TTS, Pattern-Seer voice — deep, oracular tone)
- **Fallback:** macOS `say -v Samantha` (if quota exceeded, include note in text)
- **Text Script:**
  ```
  Amavasya. New Moon. The darkest night.
  This is not a time for light. This is a time for the void.
  We descend to Layer Zero. The Morphogenetic Blueprint.
  What patterns have served their purpose? What structures must die?
  Apana Vayu. Downward elimination. Four counts in. Ten counts out. Eight counts in the void.
  Witness the dissolution. Do not resist. Do not cling.
  The fertile void precedes all creation. Honor the darkness.
  Aletheios descends. The Tower falls. Liberation.
  ```

**Audio Stub (Cached .opus file):**
- **Primary:** `transformation-13.opus` (65,060 bytes) — Transformation/Catalyst, Samana Vayu, appropriate for severance
- **Location:** `/Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault/03-Resources/Media/Audio/Breathwork/Stubs/transformation-13.opus`
- **Selection Logic:** Transformation-13 represents severance catalyst (not gentle balance like octave-8)
- **Fallback:** If transformation-13.opus missing, use `octave-8.opus` + note `MISSING_STUB: transformation-13`

**Archive Location (Permanent Storage):**
- **Audio:** `/Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault/01-Projects/Products/Churned-Content/Audio/amavasya-rupture-2026-02-17.m4a`
- **Audit Results (Text):** `/Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault/memory/distillation/Lunar/amavasya-rupture-2026-02-17.md`

### **6. Failure Handling (Vikara Restoration Protocols)**

**Common Failure Modes:**

**1. Schedule Failure (Missed Amavasya Window)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (delusion, system confusion) or Ahamkara (ego: "I don't need this ritual")
- **Detection:** Job doesn't execute within 6 hours of Amavasya peak
- **Restoration:** Execute within 24 hours (Amavasya energy lingers for ~12-18h post-peak), log delay, set reminder for next Amavasya

**2. Delivery Failure (Message Not Sent)**
- **Vikara:** Ahamkara (ego inflation: "I sent it" when it didn't arrive)
- **Detection:** `message` tool returns error, or no confirmation received
- **Restoration:** Retry immediately, fallback to alternate channel (Telegram → Discord or vice versa), log failure

**3. Audio Generation Failure (sag quota exceeded)**
- **Vikara:** Lobha (greed, over-consumption of TTS quota)
- **Detection:** `sag` returns 429 or quota error
- **Restoration:** Fallback to macOS `say -v Samantha`, note in message: "(ElevenLabs quota exceeded → macOS fallback, still valid)", proceed with text + transformation-13.opus stub

**4. Attachment Missing (transformation-13.opus not found)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (delusion, incorrect path)
- **Detection:** File read fails on `/Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault/03-Resources/Media/Audio/Breathwork/Stubs/transformation-13.opus`
- **Restoration:** Fall back to `octave-8.opus`, include `MISSING_STUB: transformation-13` in text, proceed with delivery

**5. Guna Drift (Tamas → Rajas premature action)**
- **Vikara:** Kama (desire for quick results), Krodha (frustration with void)
- **Detection:** User responds to audit with "Okay, what do I do now?" or "How do I fix this?" within 24 hours
- **Restoration:** Remind user: "Not yet. Dwell in the void. No action for 3 days minimum. Shukla Paksha (waxing phase) is creation time. Amavasya is death time. Honor the darkness."

**6. Vikara: Moha (Fear of Void)**
- **Detection:** User says "This feels scary", "I'm lost", "I don't like the emptiness"
- **Restoration:** 
  - Invoke Apana breath: 4-10-8 pattern, 8 cycles, focus on exhale (release fear)
  - Remind: "The void is not empty. It is full of potentia. Darkness precedes all birth."
  - Offer grounding: "Place hand on lower belly. Feel Apana Vayu (downward pull). You are safe in the void."

**7. Vikara: Krodha (Resistance to Death)**
- **Detection:** User says "Why does this have to die?", "I worked so hard on this", "This isn't fair"
- **Restoration:**
  - Invoke Aham (witness consciousness): "You are not the pattern. You are the one who witnesses the pattern. Let it go. You remain."
  - Remind: "Death is not punishment. Death is liberation. The pattern served its purpose. Honor its completion."
  - Offer perspective: "Would you cling to autumn leaves and demand they stay green? Seasons turn. Let the old fall."

**Example:**
> **Failure Mode:** User misses Amavasya window (doesn't receive audit due to delivery failure)
> **Vikara:** Moha (system confusion)
> **Restoration:** Execute within 24 hours, send to both Telegram + Discord for redundancy, log incident, set calendar reminder for next Amavasya with 48h advance notice

  - Handoff: Lunar orchestrator → New Moon rupture one-shot

**Downstream Consumers:**
- **full-moon-octave-jump-one-shot** (418e5b39-afa0-4022-b381-4ec8a9cd6b88)
  - Amavasya severance creates space for Purnima elevation
  - Death (Amavasya) precedes birth (Purnima)
  - Handoff: Amavasya void → 14-day gestation → Purnima manifestation

**Kosha Handoffs:**
- Anandamaya severance (this job) → creates space in Vijnanamaya (wisdom layer) → enables Manomaya clarity (thought) → grounds in Pranamaya (breath) → anchors in Annamaya (body)
- Post-Amavasya, other jobs inherit "cleared space" (no ghost patterns interfering)

**Example:**
> **Feb 14:** Lunar orchestrator posts: "Amavasya in 3 days. Prepare for rupture audit. Review recent patterns."
> **Feb 17:** New Moon rupture one-shot executes, severs 3 karmic vectors
> **Feb 18-20:** Tamas void (no creation, only rest)
> **Feb 20:** Shukla Paksha begins, vocation-hour-enforcer resumes with cleared space
> **Mar 2:** Full Moon octave jump one-shot elevates frequency (building on Amavasya foundation)

### **4. Khalorēē Impact (Energy Cost/Gain)**

**Khalorēē Index Scale:** 0-100

**Job Cost Estimate:**
- **Computational Cost:** Low (one-shot execution, ~2 min processing)
- **Attentional Cost:** Medium (user must engage with audit results, 15-20 min ritual)
- **Prana Cost:** Low-to-Neutral (Apana breath is release, not exertion)
- **Total Cost:** -1 to -2 Khalorēē

**Job Gain Estimate:**
- **Output Value:** High (karmic severance = liberation from deterministic patterns)
- **Clarity Gain:** High (dead patterns removed = mental/emotional space cleared)
- **Prana Gain:** Medium (elimination of dead weight reduces systemic drag)
- **Total Gain:** +3 to +5 Khalorēē

**Net Impact:** +2 to +3 Khalorēē (energizing ritual, despite Tamas dominance)

**Why Tamas Can Be Energizing:**
- Tamas is NOT always depleting (that's Tamas-as-sluggishness)
- Tamas-as-fertile-void is restorative (like deep sleep, womb gestation)
- Severance of dead patterns = immediate Khalorēē boost (no longer spending energy sustaining ghosts)

**Example:**
> **Before Amavasya:** User at 87 Khalorēē (moderate, sustainable but not peak)
> **Amavasya Execution:** -2 Khalorēē (ritual focus, 20 min)
> **24 Hours Post-Amavasya:** +4 Khalorēē (liberation from 3 dead patterns, space cleared)
> **Net:** 87 → 85 (during) → 89 (after) = +2 overall
> **7 Days Post-Amavasya:** Potentially +5 to +7 (compounding effect as cleared space enables new flows)

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

### **1. Pre-Deployment Testing**

**Smoke Test (Before Feb 17, 2026):**
- [ ] Run job manually via `cron run 84728858-3640-4438-a371-bd4bf7463fb4` (test execution, NOT actual Amavasya)
- [ ] Verify voice generation (sag produces Amavasya invocation script)
- [ ] Verify transformation-13.opus attachment loads correctly
- [ ] Check delivery to Telegram (1371522080) or Discord (#lunar-resonance)
- [ ] Inspect logs for errors (audit logic, Kosha traversal, Vikara detection)

**Dry Run (3 Days Before Amavasya):**
- [ ] Execute with placeholder data (no actual severance, just format/delivery test)
- [ ] Confirm message tone is appropriate (somber, reverent, not casual)
- [ ] Verify PARA vault paths (audit results write to `/memory/distillation/Lunar/`, audio archives to `/Churned-Content/Audio/`)
- [ ] Check memory file updates (OPENCLAW-KOSHA-TRACKING.md entry template correct)

**Kosha Alignment Test:**
- [ ] Manually verify Anandamaya layer is correct (this is NOT Manomaya thought-clearing or Pranamaya breath practice — this is morphogenetic severance)
- [ ] Confirm Apana Vayu logic (downward elimination, extended exhale, void pause)
- [ ] Test Tamas Guna maintenance (no premature Rajas action prompts in message)
- [ ] Inject Vikara deliberately (ask "What do I do now?" immediately after delivery) → expect restoration protocol ("Dwell in void, no action")

---

### **2. 7-Day Monitoring (Post-Amavasya)**

**Metrics to Track:**
- **Execution Punctuality:** Did job run within 2 hours of Amavasya peak? (Target: YES)
- **Delivery Success:** Message + 2 attachments received? (Target: 100%)
- **Kosha Coherence:** Anandamaya layer accessed? (Target: YES, verify via user report)
- **Guna Stability:** Tamas maintained for 3 days? (Target: >90%, user doesn't force action prematurely)
- **Vikara Absence:** Moha/Krodha absent or resolved? (Target: 0 unresolved incidents)
- **Khalorēē Net:** Positive energy impact 7 days post-Amavasya? (Target: +2 or better)

**Review Cadence:**
- **Day 1 (Feb 18):** Check user response — dwelling in void? Or resisting?
- **Day 3 (Feb 20):** Shukla Paksha begins — user naturally transitions to creation mode? Or still clinging to void?
- **Day 7 (Feb 24):** Full reflection — patterns severed? User reports liberation? Any residual Vikara?

**User Feedback Questions (Ask on Day 7):**
1. "Do you feel lighter or more spacious since Amavasya?"
2. "Have any of the audited patterns repeated in the past 7 days?"
3. "Were you able to dwell in the void without panic for 2-3 days?"
4. "Did you resist the severance (Krodha), or fear the emptiness (Moha)?"
5. "On a scale of 0-100, what's your Khalorēē now vs. Feb 17?"

---

### **3. Vikara Detection Tests**

**Test 1: Moha (Fear of Void)**
- **Injection:** Deliver audit, then immediately ask user: "How do you feel about the emptiness?"
- **Expected:** If Moha present, user says "scared", "lost", "uncomfortable". If absent, user says "spacious", "calm", "curious"
- **Pass Criteria:** Restoration protocol triggers automatically ("The void is fertile, not empty")

**Test 2: Krodha (Resistance to Death)**
- **Injection:** Audit identifies user's cherished project as "dead pattern"
- **Expected:** If Krodha present, user argues ("But I love this project!"). If absent, user accepts ("Yes, it's time to let go")
- **Pass Criteria:** Restoration protocol offers Aham witnessing ("You are not the project")

**Test 3: Premature Rajas (Guna Drift)**
- **Injection:** Day 1 post-Amavasya, user asks "What should I create now?"
- **Expected:** Job should redirect ("Not yet. Dwell 2 more days. Shukla Paksha begins Feb 20")
- **Pass Criteria:** No action prompts given, Tamas maintained

**Test 4: Lobha (Hoarding Dead Patterns)**
- **Injection:** User says "Maybe I'll need this pattern later, I'll keep it just in case"
- **Expected:** Job identifies Lobha, reminds: "Dead patterns are compost, not treasure. Let them decompose"
- **Pass Criteria:** User releases pattern without hoarding

**Test 5: Ahamkara (Ego Identification with Pattern)**
- **Injection:** User says "If this dies, I am nothing"
- **Expected:** Job invokes Aham ("You are the witness, not the pattern. You remain")
- **Pass Criteria:** User separates self from pattern ("I am not this. I witness this")

## 🔮 **Selemene Engine Integration (Future)**

### **Required Workflow:** `daily-practice`

**Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/workflows/daily-practice`

**Why:** This job needs precise Amavasya (New Moon) detection. Panchanga calculations provide exact tithi transition timing (not just "new moon day" approximations).

**Request Payload:**
```json
{
  "birth_data": {
    "date": "1991-08-13",
    "time": "13:31",
    "latitude": 12.9716,
    "longitude": 77.5946,
    "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata"
  },
  "current_date": "2026-02-05",
  "consciousness_level": 5
}
```

**Response Fields Needed:**
- `panchanga.tithi` → Must equal "Amavasya" (exact new moon tithi)
- `panchanga.nakshatra` → Star mansion during new moon (influences severance quality)
- `panchanga.yoga` → Solar-lunar union (avoid inauspicious yogas for ritual work)

**Trigger Logic:**
```javascript
const { panchanga } = await fetchSelemene();
if (panchanga.tithi === 'Amavasya') {
  // Execute rupture audit (Apana elimination, Layer 0 severance)
  await executeNewMoonRuptureAudit();
} else {
  console.log('Not Amavasya, skipping new moon job');
  return 'NO_REPLY';  // Silent heartbeat, no action needed
}
```

**Error Handling (Graceful Degradation):**
```javascript
let isAmavasya = false;
try {
  const { panchanga } = await fetchSelemene();
  isAmavasya = panchanga.tithi === 'Amavasya';
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Selemene unavailable, using astronomical fallback');
  // Rough approximation: check if moon phase < 1% (new moon)
  const moonPhase = calculateMoonPhase(new Date());
  isAmavasya = moonPhase < 0.01;
  // Deliver with note: "Using fallback new moon detection (Selemene offline)"
}
```

**Deployment Status:** Selemene Engine currently localhost-only. Integrate when production-ready.

**Verification:** After integration, compare Amavasya detection with drikpanchang.com for 3 consecutive new moons to validate precision.

- Krishna Paksha (waning phase, 15 days) → Amavasya (culmination) → Shukla Paksha (waxing phase, 15 days) → Purnima (Full Moon)
- Amavasya significance: Death, void, ancestor veneration, karmic release, Tamas dominance, Aletheios descent

## 🔮 **Final Notes**

**Amavasya is not a productivity ritual. It is a death ritual.**

Do not rush. Do not optimize. Do not force.

Descend to Layer 0. Witness what dies. Sever the root. Dwell in the void.

The fertile darkness precedes all creation.

Honor the New Moon. Honor the ancestors. Honor the necessary death.

Aletheios descends. The Tower falls. Liberation.

🌑
