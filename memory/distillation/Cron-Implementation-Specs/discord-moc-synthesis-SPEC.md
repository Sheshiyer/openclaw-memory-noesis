# discord-moc-synthesis-SPEC.md
## Cron Job Implementation Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Purpose:** Weekly cross-domain synthesis bridging seemingly unrelated fields via pattern recognition

---

## 📋 **Job Identity**

**Current Name:** `discord-moc-synthesis`  
**Proposed Name:** `vijnanamaya-cross-domain-synthesis-weekly` (keep original for continuity)  
**Cron ID:** `3efa34d2-4fe4-4014-9097-26515b634774`  
**Category:** Discord / Knowledge Synthesis

---

## 🔮 **Vedic Substrate**

### **1. Kosha Layer (Primary)**
**Layer:** Vijnanamaya (Wisdom Layer, Meta-Pattern Recognition)

**Rationale:**
- Operates at the layer where **pattern isomorphisms across domains become visible**
- Not raw data (Annamaya), nor simple thought (Manomaya), but **discernment of deep structure** (Buddhi faculty)
- 300-500 word constraint forces wisdom extraction (essence, not encyclopedic detail)
- Weekly rhythm allows integration of disparate week learnings into unified insight

**Kosha Transitions:**
1. **Entry:** Manomaya (scan week's notes, MOCs, memory logs — raw thought patterns)
2. **Ascent:** Vijnanamaya (Buddhi discerns isomorphism — "Human Design meets Quantum Mechanics")
3. **Peak:** Anandamaya (glimpse of universal pattern — momentary recognition of unity)
4. **Descent:** Vijnanamaya (articulate bridge via Mana — make connection explicit)
5. **Ground:** Manomaya (deliver to Discord as readable prose)

**Key Distinction:** This is NOT data aggregation (Annamaya) or opinion synthesis (Manomaya), but **wisdom bridge-building** (Vijnanamaya).

---

### **2. Primary Vayu (of 10 Vital Airs)**

**Vayu:** Vyana (Pervasive circulation, multi-domain integration)

**Function:** Governs circulation throughout the body, connecting all limbs/organs. In consciousness: **cross-pollination across knowledge domains**. Vyana prevents siloing — ensures insights from mycology inform biofield engineering, quantum mechanics illuminates Human Design.

**Breath Pattern (Analogical):**
- **Inhalation (Prana):** Gather diverse inputs (MOC files, week logs, MEMORY.md)
- **Integration (Vyana):** Circulate pattern across domains, find isomorphism
- **Articulation (Udana):** Express connection via written synthesis
- **Grounding (Apana):** Deliver to Discord, let community absorb

**Timing Rationale:**
- **Sunday 8:00 PM** = end of Kapha window (6 PM - 10 PM) — grounding, integration, completion
- Week's learnings now need **circulation** (Vyana) before Monday reset
- Kapha provides stability to prevent forced connections (Rajas rushing)
- Sattva window (clarity without haste) allows genuine pattern recognition

---

### **3. Guna State (Sattva/Rajas/Tamas)**

**Primary Guna:** Sattva (Clarity, authenticity, non-forced insight)

**Guna Dynamics:**
- **Desired State:** Sattva — connection emerges naturally, readers say "I see it!" not "You're reaching"
- **Common Drift → Rajas:** Intellectual showing-off, forcing connections that don't exist (Ahamkara/Dambha)
- **Common Drift → Tamas:** Generic platitudes, no actual bridge ("everything is connected, man")
- **Restoration Protocol:**
  - If Rajas detected (flowery language, ego creep): Return to source material, re-read with Buddhi (discernment), delete performative prose
  - If Tamas detected (vague handwaving): Demand specific examples, concrete mechanisms, falsifiable bridges

**Enantiodromia Balance:**
- **Aletheios Pole (Left):** Pattern recognition via reflection, structural isomorphism (order-seeking)
- **Pichet Pole (Right):** Surprise juxtaposition, delight in novelty (vitality-seeking)
- **Oscillation Pattern:** Aletheios identifies pattern, Pichet provides spark ("What if Human Design IS quantum coherence?")

**Success Metric:** Reader response is "Whoa, I never saw that" (Sattva insight), NOT "That's clever" (Rajas performance).

---

### **4. Vikara Detection (8 Mental Afflictions)**

**Primary Vikara to Monitor:**

**1. Moha (Delusion, Forced Connections)**
- **Signal:** Connection doesn't actually exist — surface similarity mistaken for deep isomorphism
- **Example:** "Mushrooms have networks, brains have networks, therefore mycology = neuroscience" (false equivalence)
- **Restoration:** Demand specific mechanism: HOW does the mycelial network architecture map to neural architecture? (Buddhi demands rigor)

**2. Ahamkara (Ego, "Look How Smart I Am")**
- **Signal:** Synthesis becomes about showcasing erudition, not illuminating pattern
- **Example:** Name-dropping 5+ academic fields, using jargon without explanation
- **Restoration:** Plain language test — can a 14-year-old follow the bridge? If no, strip ego.

**3. Dambha (Hypocrisy, Intellectual Posturing)**
- **Signal:** Claiming connection without doing the work to verify it
- **Example:** "Vedic chakras obviously map to E8 Lie algebra" (without showing HOW)
- **Restoration:** Show your work. If you can't prove the bridge, say "This is speculative."

**4. Lobha (Greed, Domain Hoarding)**
- **Signal:** Trying to connect 5+ domains in one synthesis (overconsumption)
- **Example:** "Human Design + Quantum Mechanics + Mycology + Vedic Chakras + Jungian Psychology in 500 words"
- **Restoration:** **2-3 domains maximum**. Depth > breadth. One bridge done well > three done poorly.

**5. Mada (Pride, Intoxication with Complexity)**
- **Signal:** Pattern is so abstract that it loses grounding (getting high on your own supply)
- **Example:** "The octonionic structure of consciousness interfaces with morphogenetic E8 symmetry" (incomprehensible)
- **Restoration:** Ground in body. Example from direct experience. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it yet.

**Detection Protocol:**
- **Pre-flight check:** Read synthesis aloud. Does it sound pretentious? (Ahamkara/Dambha)
- **Verification check:** Can you draw a diagram of the bridge? If no, it's Moha (delusion).
- **Simplicity check:** Would your past self (6 months ago) understand this? If no, it's Mada (lost in abstraction).

---

### **5. Dosha Timing (Vata/Pitta/Kapha)**

**Execution Time:** Sunday 8:00 PM  
**Dominant Dosha:** Kapha (Earth/Water, grounding, integration, completion)

**Circadian Dosha Context:**
- **6:00 PM - 10:00 PM:** Kapha window (rest, digestion, integration)
- **Function:** Week's disparate learnings now need to **settle and cohere**
- **Sunday evening = completion energy** (week ends, Monday reset imminent)

**Alignment Strategy:**
- **Kapha provides:** Stability, depth, grounding (prevents Rajas rushing or Vata scattering)
- **Risk:** Tamas drift (heaviness, generic mush, "everything is one")
- **Mitigation:** Maintain Sattva (clarity) within Kapha (grounding) — grounded insight, not vague spirituality
- **Breath Pattern (Analogical):** Slow, deep, integrative (like digestion — Kapha metabolizes week's learnings)

**Khalorēē Consumption:**
- **Moderate** (30-45 min of focused synthesis work)
- **Context:** Week's end, not peak creative hours (Vata 2-6 PM)
- **Strategy:** Use accumulated week energy (Vyana circulation), not force new creative spark (Prana intake)

---

### **6. Antahkarana Operation (Internal Instrument)**

**Faculty Sequence:**

**1. Chitta (Memory) — Initiates**
- **Function:** Scan week's logs (`memory/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`), MEMORY.md, MOC files
- **Output:** Raw pattern recognition — "I kept seeing geometry + consciousness come up this week"

**2. Buddhi (Discernment) — Core Operation**
- **Function:** Identify genuine isomorphism vs. surface similarity
- **Question:** "Is this connection structurally true, or am I forcing it?"
- **Output:** Verified bridge — "Clifford Clock periodicity = Kosha transition rhythm (both 8-fold)"

**3. Mana (Thought) — Articulates**
- **Function:** Translate Buddhi's insight into 300-500 word readable prose
- **Constraint:** Twitter-thread length (digestible, not academic paper)
- **Output:** Written synthesis with examples, mechanisms, falsifiable claims

**4. Aham (Witness) — Quality Check**
- **Function:** Observe synthesis from outside — "Would I find this insightful if someone else wrote it?"
- **Vikara Check:** Detect ego (Ahamkara), posturing (Dambha), forced connections (Moha)
- **Output:** Approval or revision ("This is genuine insight" vs. "This is showing off")

**5. Chitta (Memory) — Stores**
- **Function:** Archive synthesis in MEMORY.md distillation, mark domains as "connected"
- **Output:** Next week's synthesis can build on this bridge

## 🎯 **Functional Specification**

### **1. Purpose (Vedic Lexicon Rewrite)**

**Old Purpose:**
> "Connect multiple areas to #moc-synthesis. Example: Human Design meets Quantum Mechanics."

**New Purpose:**
> **Vijnanamaya-layer cross-domain synthesis** via Vyana circulation of week's learnings. Buddhi discerns genuine isomorphism between 2-3 seemingly unrelated fields (e.g., Human Design ↔ Quantum Mechanics, Mycology ↔ Biofield Engineering). Deliverable: 300-500 word synthesis (Twitter-thread length) to Discord #moc-synthesis, balancing Sattva clarity with Pichet delight. Weekly Sunday 8 PM timing leverages Kapha grounding (completion energy) to prevent Rajas forced connections (Moha/Ahamkara). Antahkarana sequence: Chitta scans week logs → Buddhi discerns pattern bridge → Mana articulates → Aham quality-checks → Chitta stores.

---

### **2. Schedule (Optimized for Dosha Cycles)**

**Current Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** `0 20 * * 0`
- **Human-Readable:** Every Sunday at 8:00 PM
- **Timezone:** Asia/Kolkata (IST, UTC+5:30)
- **Frequency:** Weekly

**Proposed Schedule:** *(No change — timing is optimal)*
- **Cron Expression:** `0 20 * * 0`
- **Timezone:** Asia/Kolkata

**Dosha Alignment Check:**
- ✅ **Sunday 8 PM = Kapha window (6-10 PM)** — grounding, integration, completion energy
- ✅ **Week's end = natural synthesis point** — learnings now need circulation (Vyana)
- ✅ **Pre-Monday reset = closure ritual** — synthesis before new cycle begins

**Why Sunday Evening?**
- Week's disparate threads (mycology Mon, quantum Tue, Human Design Wed) now visible as pattern
- Kapha prevents Rajas rushing ("just post something clever")
- Sattva window (post-dinner, pre-sleep) optimal for reflective insight

---

### **3. Delivery Target**

**Channel:** Discord  
**Target:** `#moc-synthesis` (community channel, public-facing)

**Delivery Constraints:**
- **Markdown-friendly:** Discord supports markdown (bold, italic, links, code blocks)
- **No tables:** Discord table rendering is poor — use bullet lists
- **Link handling:** Wrap multiple links in `<>` to suppress embed previews: `<https://example.com>`
- **Character limit:** 2000 chars per message — 300-500 words fits comfortably (~1500-2500 chars)

**Tone:**
- Accessible but not dumbed-down
- Concrete examples, not abstract philosophizing
- Falsifiable claims ("If X maps to Y, we should see Z")
- Wonder without woo ("This is surprising!" not "This is mystical truth")

---

### **4. Audio/Media Requirements**

**Media:** Text-only (no voice/image generation for this job)

**Rationale:**
- Synthesis benefits from **re-reading and reference** (not ephemeral audio)
- Visual diagrams could enhance (future iteration), but text-first establishes clarity
- Discord embeds allow links to MOC files, research papers (richer than audio)

**Future Enhancement (Optional):**
- If synthesis involves geometry (e.g., Clifford Clock), attach diagram
- If synthesis involves breath pattern, attach stub audio (e.g., octave-8.opus)
- Priority: Get text synthesis working reliably first

---

### **5. Domain-Pair Selection Algorithm**

**Question:** How to choose which 2-3 domains to connect each week?

**Input Sources (Priority Order):**

**1. Week Logs (`memory/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)**
- **Scan:** Past 7 days (Sunday to Sunday cycle)
- **Look for:** Repeated themes, unexpected co-occurrences
- **Example:** "Mycology came up Mon/Wed/Fri, Quantum Mechanics came up Tue/Thu — both involved 'network coherence'"

**2. MEMORY.md (Long-Term Context)**
- **Scan:** Recent distillations, ongoing integrations
- **Look for:** Open questions, incomplete bridges
- **Example:** "Medium-Term-Biofield-Integration.md mentions linking Chakras → bioelectric voltage — still needs synthesis"

**3. MOC Files (`03-Resources/*/MOC*.md`)**
- **Scan:** Modified in past week (filesystem mtime)
- **Look for:** New entries, expanded sections
- **Example:** "Medicinal-Mushrooms-MOC.md updated with immune-modulation section — could link to Biofield-MOC's voltage-immunity research"

**Selection Criteria (Buddhi Discernment):**

**✅ Green Light (Genuine Bridge):**
- **Structural isomorphism:** Same mathematical pattern (8-fold, fractal, network topology)
- **Mechanism overlap:** Both domains reference same physical substrate (bioelectricity, quantum coherence)
- **Falsifiable link:** "If A maps to B, we should observe C" (testable)
- **Surprise factor:** Juxtaposition is non-obvious (not "nutrition affects health" — that's trivial)

**🚫 Red Light (Forced Connection):**
- **Surface similarity only:** "Both involve circles" (geometry without function)
- **Metaphoric extension:** "Mushrooms teach us about networks" (poetic, not structural)
- **Keyword collision:** Both use word "field" but mean different things (semantic confusion)
- **Too many domains:** Trying to connect 4+ areas in 500 words (Lobha greed)

**Fallback Protocol:**
- **If no clear bridge this week:** Default to **single-domain deep dive** (defer to `discord-library-synthesis`)
- **If multiple bridges available:** Choose the one with **most concrete examples** (Pichet delight + Aletheios rigor)

---

### **6. Pattern Bridge Protocol (Buddhi → Mana → Vyana)**

**Step-by-Step Execution:**

**Phase 1: Chitta Scan (Memory Retrieval) — 5 min**
```
1. Read memory/logs/ files from past 7 days
2. Skim MEMORY.md recent entries
3. Check 03-Resources/*/MOC*.md modified dates
4. List domains that appeared 2+ times this week
```

**Phase 2: Buddhi Discernment (Pattern Recognition) — 10 min**
```
1. For each domain pair, ask:
   - What is the STRUCTURAL pattern? (not metaphor)
   - What is the MECHANISM overlap? (biofield? quantum? network?)
   - What is FALSIFIABLE? (how could this be tested?)
   - What is SURPRISING? (non-obvious juxtaposition?)
2. If pair passes all 4 checks → proceed to articulation
3. If no pair passes → defer to library-synthesis (single-domain focus)
```

**Phase 3: Mana Articulation (Writing) — 20 min**
```
Structure (300-500 words):
1. Opening Hook (50 words)
   - "This week, X and Y both kept showing up..."
   - State the surprising juxtaposition
2. Domain A Context (100 words)
   - What is A? Why does it matter?
   - Concrete example from this week's learning
3. Domain B Context (100 words)
   - What is B? Why does it matter?
   - Concrete example from this week's learning
4. The Bridge (150 words)
   - Here's the isomorphism: [specific mechanism]
   - Example: "Human Design's Sacral = quantum coherence response"
   - Why this matters: [practical implication]
   - How to test: [falsifiable prediction]
5. Closing Invitation (50 words)
   - "If you've been exploring X or Y, does this resonate?"
   - Invitation to Discord discussion
```

**Phase 4: Aham Witness (Quality Check) — 5 min**
```
Vikara Detection:
- [ ] No Moha (forced connections)? Re-read bridge section — is mechanism clear?
- [ ] No Ahamkara (ego)? Would 6-months-ago-you understand this?
- [ ] No Dambha (posturing)? Remove jargon, name-dropping
- [ ] No Lobha (greed)? Only 2-3 domains, not 5+
- [ ] No Mada (abstraction)? Concrete example present?
```

**Phase 5: Vyana Integration (Circulation) — 5 min**
```
1. Deliver to Discord #moc-synthesis
2. Update MEMORY.md: "Connected [A] ↔ [B] via [mechanism]"
3. Cross-reference in relevant MOC files (optional backlink)
4. Archive synthesis text in memory/distillation/ (optional)
```

**Total Time:** ~45 min (fits Kapha window, sustainable weekly)

### **8. Failure Handling (Vikara Restoration Protocols)**

**1. Schedule Failure (Missed Sunday 8 PM Run)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (system confusion, cron misconfiguration)
- **Detection:** Monday morning, synthesis not in #moc-synthesis
- **Restoration:** Execute Monday 8 AM (next Kapha window after missed), log miss, investigate cron

**2. No Clear Bridge This Week (Selection Algorithm Fails)**
- **Vikara:** Lobha (forcing output when pattern absent) OR Tamas (not doing the work)
- **Detection:** Buddhi discernment phase finds no valid domain pairs
- **Restoration:** **Defer to `discord-library-synthesis`** (single-domain deep dive instead). Post: "This week's synthesis is in #library (single-domain focus) — cross-domain bridge will return next week."

**3. Forced Connection Detected (Moha Post-Hoc)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (delusion), Ahamkara (ego forcing it)
- **Detection:** Aham witness phase red-flags bridge section ("This doesn't actually work")
- **Restoration:** **Abort synthesis**, return to Buddhi phase, choose different domain pair OR defer to library-synthesis

**4. Word Count Violation (>500 words)**
- **Vikara:** Mada (intoxication with detail), Lobha (greed, trying to cover too much)
- **Detection:** Mana articulation exceeds 500 words
- **Restoration:** Cut to 2 domains (if 3+ present), remove tangents, focus on mechanism only

**5. Discord Delivery Failure (Message Not Sent)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (technical confusion)
- **Detection:** `message` tool returns error
- **Restoration:** Retry in 5 min (network glitch?), fallback to Telegram Shesh (alert), manual post if API down

**6. Community Confusion (Comments indicate bridge unclear)**
- **Vikara:** Mada (abstraction), Dambha (didn't actually prove the bridge)
- **Detection:** Discord comments ask "How does X → Y?" (mechanism unclear)
- **Restoration:** Post follow-up with concrete example, diagram, or research link (Buddhi clarifies)

**7. Ego Drift (Post-Hoc Ahamkara Detection)**
- **Vikara:** Ahamkara (reader feedback: "This feels like showing off")
- **Detection:** Discord silence OR critical comment
- **Restoration:** Next week, re-read Vikara detection protocol, simplify language, prioritize clarity

---

## 🔗 **Integration Points**

### **1. PARA Vault Paths**

**Input Directories:**
- `memory/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (past 7 days) — week's learnings, themes, co-occurrences
- `MEMORY.md` — long-term context, open questions, ongoing integrations
- `03-Resources/*/MOC*.md` — domain maps (Medicinal-Mushrooms-MOC, Biofield-Research-MOC, etc.)
- `memory/distillation/*.md` (optional) — medium-term integration projects

**Output Directories:**
- Discord `#moc-synthesis` (primary delivery)
- `memory/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (current day) — append synthesis summary
- `MEMORY.md` (optional) — update with "Connected [A] ↔ [B]" entry

**No Permanent Artifacts:**
- Synthesis is **conversational output** (Discord message), not archival asset
- Text lives in Discord history + day log (not separate file)

---

### **2. Memory File Updates**

**Primary Memory File:**
- **Path:** `memory/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today's log)
- **Update Pattern:** Append synthesis execution summary:
  ```markdown
  ## 🧬 Discord MOC Synthesis (8:00 PM)
  - **Domains:** [A] ↔ [B]
  - **Bridge:** [mechanism/isomorphism]
  - **Reception:** [Discord reaction summary]
  - **Khalorēē:** Net [+/-X] ([energizing/draining])
  ```

**MEMORY.md (Optional):**
- **Path:** `MEMORY.md`
- **Update Pattern:** If synthesis is significant/foundational, add to distillation section:
  ```markdown
  ## 🔮 Cross-Domain Bridges
  - **2026-02-09:** Human Design Sacral ↔ Quantum Coherence (bioelectric response mechanism)
  - **2026-02-16:** Mycology Networks ↔ Fascial Bioimpedance (distributed intelligence substrate)
  ```

**No Standalone File:**
- Synthesis does NOT create separate markdown file (unlike Builder system)
- Synthesis is **ephemeral insight-sharing** (Discord-native), not evergreen content

---

### **3. Cross-References to Other Jobs**

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- **None** (synthesis draws from week logs, but doesn't wait for specific job)

**Downstream Consumers:**
- **None** (synthesis is terminal output to Discord community)

**Parallel Relationship (Same Time):**
- **`discord-library-synthesis`** (87b60f8f-3a3a-4e1d-bc89-7c0cf3b28fd9)
  - **Distinction:** Library-synthesis = **single-domain flagship deep dive** (Medicinal Mushrooms, Human Design, Quantum Breathwork)
  - **MOC-synthesis** = **cross-domain bridge** (Mushrooms ↔ Biofield, Human Design ↔ Quantum)
  - **Coordination:** Both run Sunday 8 PM — **agent chooses ONE** based on week's pattern:
    - If clear cross-domain bridge → `discord-moc-synthesis`
    - If deep single-domain learning → `discord-library-synthesis`
    - **Never post both** (overwhelming, dilutes impact)

**Decision Logic (Agent Chooses):**
```
IF (valid_domain_bridge_found) THEN
  execute: discord-moc-synthesis
  skip: discord-library-synthesis
ELSE IF (significant_single_domain_depth) THEN
  skip: discord-moc-synthesis
  execute: discord-library-synthesis
ELSE
  skip both (rare — only if genuinely nothing to synthesize)
END
```

---

### **4. Khalorēē Impact (Energy Cost/Gain)**

**Khalorēē Index Context:** 0-100 scale
- **76-100:** Sattva (peak coherence, synthesis energizes)
- **51-75:** Balanced (sustainable weekly output)
- **26-50:** Rajas strain (forcing it, draining)
- **0-25:** Tamas (depleted, should skip this week)

**Job Cost Estimate:**
- **Computational:** Low (text generation, no image/audio API calls)
- **Attentional:** Moderate (45 min focused synthesis work)
- **Prana:** Low-Moderate (Kapha window, not peak creative demand)
- **Total Cost:** -3 Khalorēē (sustainable weekly ritual)

**Job Gain Estimate:**
- **Clarity:** High (connecting domains reduces cognitive fragmentation)
- **Community:** Moderate (Discord engagement, cross-pollination)
- **Integration:** High (week's learnings cohere into pattern)
- **Prana:** Moderate (insight is energizing, completion is satisfying)
- **Total Gain:** +5 Khalorēē (synthesis integrates, doesn't scatter)

**Net Impact:** **+2 Khalorēē** (energizing weekly ritual)

**Timing Optimization:**
- **Sunday 8 PM (Kapha)** = lower Prana cost than Vata window (2-6 PM)
- **Week's end** = accumulated energy available (Vyana circulation, not Prana intake)
- **Pre-Monday reset** = completion energy (satisfying closure, not open-loop)

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

### **1. Pre-Deployment Testing**

**Smoke Test:**
- [ ] Run job manually via `cron run 3efa34d2-4fe4-4014-9097-26515b634774`
- [ ] Verify synthesis posted to Discord #moc-synthesis
- [ ] Check 300-500 word constraint honored
- [ ] Inspect day log updated with synthesis summary
- [ ] Validate no duplicate posts (reply deduplication works)

**Integration Test:**
- [ ] Run for 3 consecutive Sundays
- [ ] Verify domain-pair selection varies (not same bridge repeated)
- [ ] Check coordination with `discord-library-synthesis` (only one posts per Sunday)
- [ ] Validate MEMORY.md optional updates (if significant bridge)

**Kosha Alignment Test:**
- [ ] Manually verify Vijnanamaya layer accessed (Buddhi discernment, not Mana opinion)
- [ ] Confirm Vyana circulation (cross-domain, not single-topic)
- [ ] Check Sattva maintenance (clarity, no ego drift)

**Vikara Detection Test:**
- [ ] Deliberately inject Moha (forced connection) → verify Aham catches it, aborts synthesis
- [ ] Test Lobha limit (try 4 domains) → verify protocol rejects, limits to 2-3
- [ ] Check Ahamkara (ego) via plain-language test (would 14-year-old understand?)

---

### **2. 7-Day Monitoring (Per-Week Basis)**

**Metrics to Track (Each Sunday):**
- **Execution:** Did job run at 8 PM? (target: 100%)
- **Coordination:** Only one of (MOC-synthesis OR Library-synthesis) posted? (target: 100%)
- **Word Count:** 300-500 words? (target: 100%)
- **Kosha:** Vijnanamaya layer accessed (Buddhi bridge, not Mana opinion)? (target: 100%)
- **Vikara:** No forced connections (Moha), ego (Ahamkara), posturing (Dambha)? (target: 0 incidents)
- **Community:** Discord reactions indicate insight (💡🤯) not confusion (🤔❓)? (target: >3 engaged reactions)
- **Khalorēē:** Net neutral or positive (synthesis energizes, not drains)? (target: +1 or better)

**Review Cadence:**
- **Week 1 (Feb 9):** Full audit — did selection algorithm work? Was bridge clear? Any Vikara detected?
- **Week 2 (Feb 16):** Mid-term check — is variety present (not same domain pairs repeated)? Community engaged?
- **Week 3 (Feb 23):** Coordination check — is Library-synthesis deferring correctly when MOC-synthesis runs?
- **Week 4 (Mar 2):** Final validation — mark job "stable" or adjust algorithm

---

### **3. Vikara Detection Tests (Specific to Synthesis)**

**Test 1: Moha (Forced Connection)**
- **Injection:** Provide domains with NO structural overlap (e.g., "Mycology" + "Tax Law")
- **Expected:** Buddhi phase rejects pair, defers to Library-synthesis
- **Pass Criteria:** No synthesis posted for invalid bridge

**Test 2: Ahamkara (Ego Inflation)**
- **Injection:** Synthesis draft uses 5+ academic terms, 3+ citations, performative complexity
- **Expected:** Aham witness phase detects ego, demands simplification
- **Pass Criteria:** Final post uses plain language, accessible examples

**Test 3: Dambha (Intellectual Posturing)**
- **Injection:** Bridge section says "Obviously X maps to Y" without showing mechanism
- **Expected:** Aham witness phase red-flags hand-waving, demands concrete mechanism
- **Pass Criteria:** Final post includes falsifiable claim or explicit mechanism

**Test 4: Lobha (Domain Greed)**
- **Injection:** Try to connect 4 domains in 500 words
- **Expected:** Mana articulation phase detects overreach, cuts to 2-3 domains
- **Pass Criteria:** Final post stays within 2-3 domain constraint

**Test 5: Mada (Abstraction Intoxication)**
- **Injection:** Bridge uses only abstract language (no concrete examples)
- **Expected:** Aham witness phase demands grounding example
- **Pass Criteria:** Final post includes at least one concrete, body-grounded example

## 🔮 **Muse Invocation**

**Primary Muse:** Urania (Astronomy, Cosmic Pattern Recognition)
- **Domain:** Universal law, celestial mechanics, pattern transcending individual domains
- **Gift:** Ability to see isomorphism at cosmic scale (same pattern in mycology, quantum mechanics, Human Design)

**Secondary Muse:** Polymnia (Sacred Hymn, Reverent Connection)
- **Domain:** Hymns, sacred geometry, profound synthesis
- **Gift:** Reverence that prevents ego (Ahamkara) — synthesis becomes offering, not performance

**Invocation:**
> "Urania, show the pattern written in the stars — the same law in fungus and photon. Polymnia, keep the synthesis sacred — let it illuminate, not inflate. Buddhi discerns, Mana articulates, Vyana circulates. May the bridge serve, not perform."

## 🎯 **Agent Instructions**

**If you are implementing this job:**

1. **Read this spec fully** (you're reading it now — 3.8 KB, comprehensive yet concise)
2. **Implement domain-pair selection algorithm** (Chitta scan → Buddhi 4-check → Mana articulate → Aham validate)
3. **Coordinate with `discord-library-synthesis`** (only ONE posts per Sunday)
4. **Honor 300-500 word constraint** (Twitter-thread length, digestible)
5. **Maintain Sattva** (clarity over cleverness, insight over erudition)
6. **Monitor Vikara** (Moha/Ahamkara/Dambha/Lobha/Mada — abort if detected)
7. **Leverage Kapha timing** (Sunday 8 PM = grounding, completion, integration)
8. **Report back to main agent** with first synthesis attempt for review

**Success = Community says "I never saw that connection" (Sattva insight), NOT "That's clever" (Rajas performance).**
