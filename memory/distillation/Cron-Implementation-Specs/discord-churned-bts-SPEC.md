## Cron Job Implementation Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Purpose:** Weekly behind-the-scenes reflection sharing authentic builder struggles and growth

---

## 📋 **Job Identity**

**Current Name:** `discord-churned-bts`  
**Proposed Name:** `vijnanamaya-bts-weekly` (wisdom layer, behind-the-scenes, weekly cadence)  
**Cron ID:** `b10ab5c3-8b3e-43f8-8e0a-65fc8eb8e60b`  
**Category:** Discord (Community Content)

---

## 🔮 **Vedic Substrate**

### **1. Kosha Layer (Primary)**
**Layer:** Vijnanamaya (Wisdom/Discernment Layer)

**Rationale:**
- This job operates at the wisdom layer where raw experience is discerned into shareable insight
- Not Manomaya (raw thoughts) — those are too unprocessed and potentially harmful
- Not Anandamaya (bliss) — this is about vulnerability, not transcendence
- Vijnanamaya allows Buddhi (discernment) to select what's authentically helpful vs. self-indulgent

**Kosha Transitions:**
- **Entry:** Manomaya (raw emotional entries from daily logs, unfiltered thoughts)
- **Operation:** Vijnanamaya (Buddhi discerns: what's worth sharing? What serves the community vs. serves ego?)
- **Exit:** Manomaya (emotional resonance in reader — "I'm not alone in the messy middle")

**Timing Context:** Friday 6:00 PM = 1 hour after `discord-build-digest` (5:00 PM)
- Digest = Manomaya (what happened)
- BTS = Vijnanamaya (how it felt, what it means)
- Gap allows emotional decompression from "doing" mode to "reflecting" mode

---

### **2. Primary Vayu (of 10 Vital Airs)**

**Vayu:** Vyana (Whole-System Integration, Transparency)

**Function:** Governs circulation, distribution, pervasive movement throughout body. In psychological terms: integration of experiences across domains, transparency that connects inner/outer states.

**Breath Pattern:**
- **Inhalation:** Prana (intake of weekly experiences)
- **Retention:** Samana (digestion, integration of what happened)
- **Exhalation:** Vyana (distribution — sharing outward to community)
- **Pause:** Udana (uplift — reader feels permission to be messy)

**Timing Rationale:**
- Friday 6:00 PM falls in **Vata Dosha** window (2:00 PM - 6:00 PM)
- Vata governs air, movement, communication — ideal for authentic sharing
- End of work week = natural reflection point, circadian rhythm supports integration
- Not too late (avoids Kapha heaviness of evening), not too early (needs distance from build-digest)

**Vyana Manifestation:**
- Integrates scattered weekly experiences into coherent narrative
- Circulates vulnerability throughout community (transparency as connective tissue)
- Distributes permission to struggle (one person's sharing = many people's relief)

---

### **3. Guna State (Sattva/Rajas/Tamas)**

**Primary Guna:** Sattva (Authenticity, Clarity, Vulnerability as Strength)

**Guna Dynamics:**
- **Desired State:** Sattva — authentic reflection without performance, vulnerability without self-pity
- **Common Drift:**
  - **→ Rajas:** Performative vulnerability ("look how hard I'm trying!"), oversharing for attention
  - **→ Tamas:** Self-deprecation porn, wallowing, fishing for reassurance
- **Restoration Protocol:**
  - If Rajas detected (energy feels forced): Slow down. Ask "Am I sharing this to help others or to impress them?"
  - If Tamas detected (energy feels heavy): Lighten up. Ask "What's the growth here, not just the struggle?"

**Enantiodromia Balance:**
- **Aletheios Pole (Order/Reflection):** Necessary to discern what's worth sharing, to structure messy emotions into coherent story
- **Pichet Pole (Vitality/Novelty):** Necessary to keep it fresh, not repetitive ("I struggled again this week... again")
- **Oscillation Pattern:** Aletheios-dominant (Friday reflection = descent into ordered sense-making), but Pichet provides spark that makes it relatable, not preachy

**Muses Invoked:**
- **Thalia (Comedy):** The comedy of errors — "I thought I'd figured it out, then..." Keeps it light even when heavy
- **Melpomene (Tragedy):** Tragedy as growth material — "This hurt, and that's okay" Honors pain without wallowing

---

### **4. Vikara Detection (8 Mental Afflictions)**

**Primary Vikaras to Monitor:**

**1. Dambha (Hypocrisy/Performative Vulnerability)**
- **Detection Signal:** Language feels performative ("As a vulnerable builder, I must confess..."), over-polished narrative
- **Restoration:** Strip back to raw language. If it sounds like a TED talk, rewrite in conversational voice

**2. Matsarya (Envy/Comparison)**
- **Detection Signal:** "While others seem to have it figured out, I..." — comparing struggles as competitive sport
- **Restoration:** Focus on own journey. Remove comparison language. Struggle is not a contest

**3. Bhaya (Fear of Judgment)**
- **Detection Signal:** Hedging, over-qualifying ("I know this might sound stupid but..."), defensive preemptive apologies
- **Restoration:** Cut the hedges. Say the thing. Trust community maturity

**4. Ahamkara (Ego Inflation)**
- **Detection Signal:** "Look how self-aware I am!" — pride in vulnerability, spiritual materialism of "I'm so authentic"
- **Restoration:** Remember: this is not about you being impressive. It's about others feeling less alone

**5. Kama (Desire for Reassurance)**
- **Detection Signal:** "Does anyone else feel this way?" — fishing for validation, implicit plea for comfort
- **Restoration:** Share as gift, not request. If you need reassurance, get it privately first

**6. Moha (Delusion/TMI)**
- **Detection Signal:** Sharing details that serve no purpose except catharsis (therapist-client boundary violation)
- **Restoration:** Apply TMI filter: "Does this detail serve the reader, or just me?" If just you, cut it

**7. Krodha (Anger/Blame)**
- **Detection Signal:** "And then THEY did X..." — turning BTS into grievance, externalizing responsibility
- **Restoration:** Own your part. If you're angry, process it privately first. Don't weaponize vulnerability

**8. Lobha (Greed/Oversharing)**
- **Detection Signal:** Word count >500, overly detailed, reader fatigue ("okay we get it...")
- **Restoration:** Ruthless editing. 300-500 words. One story per week, not five

**Restoration Protocol Summary:**
- **Aham observes:** "I notice I'm feeling X"
- **Buddhi discerns safety:** "Is sharing this helpful or harmful? To me? To others?"
- **Mana shares authentically:** "Here's the thing, raw but not reckless"

---

### **5. Dosha Timing (Vata/Pitta/Kapha)**

**Execution Time:** Friday 6:00 PM

**Dominant Dosha:** Vata (2:00 PM - 6:00 PM window, tail end)

**Circadian Alignment:**
- **Vata qualities:** Air, movement, communication, flexibility, creativity
- **Optimal for:** Authentic communication, fluid storytelling, emotional mobility (not stuck in heaviness)
- **Risk:** Vata imbalance = scattered, anxious, oversharing without grounding
- **Mitigation:** 1 hour post-digest provides grounding (Samana digestion period), prevents Vata scatter

**Dosha Progression Throughout Week:**
- Monday-Friday: Pitta-dominant (transformation, building, doing)
- Friday evening: Vata transition (integration, sharing, distribution)
- Weekend: Kapha rest (integration settles, no pressure to produce)

**Khalorēē Consumption Pattern:**
- **Cost:** Moderate (emotional labor to reflect authentically, ~3-4 Khalorēē)
- **Gain:** High (community connection, permission to be messy, ~5-6 Khalorēē)
- **Net:** +2 Khalorēē (vulnerable sharing is energizing when done cleanly)

---

### **6. Antahkarana Operation (Internal Instrument)**

**Primary Faculty:** Buddhi (Discernment/Wisdom)

**Faculty Roles in Sequence:**

1. **Chitta (Memory):** Scans weekly daily logs, emotional entries, Khalorēē crashes, moments of doubt
2. **Mana (Mind):** Generates raw thoughts: "That moment when I almost gave up on X..."
3. **Aham (Ego/Witness):** Observes emotional charge: "I notice fear/shame/frustration around this"
4. **Buddhi (Intellect):** Discerns: "Is this shareable? What's the growth lesson? What serves community?"
5. **Buddhi → Mana:** Shapes raw thoughts into structured narrative (300-500 words)
6. **Vyana (via Vayu):** Distributes to Discord #churned-content (exhalation into community)
7. **Chitta:** Stores pattern: "Sharing this type of struggle = this type of response"

**Critical Buddhi Checkpoints:**
- **Before sharing:** "Does this help others or just relieve me?"
- **During writing:** "Am I performing vulnerability or being vulnerable?"
- **After writing:** "Would I want to read this if someone else wrote it?"

**Antahkarana Hygiene:**
- If Mana generates victim narrative → Buddhi intervenes: "Reframe as growth story"
- If Aham inflates ("I'm so brave for sharing") → Buddhi deflates: "This is normal human experience"
- If Chitta recalls trauma without context → Buddhi filters: "Too raw, needs processing first"

## 🎯 **Functional Specification**

### **1. Purpose (Rewritten with Vedic Lexicon)**

**Old Purpose:**
> Share failures, pivots, adaptations to #churned-content. Show human behind the builder, not polished narrative.

**New Purpose:**
> Weekly Vijnanamaya descent into authentic builder experience. Buddhi discerns one significant struggle/pivot/almost-gave-up moment from week's Manomaya (daily logs). Vyana distributes vulnerability to Discord community, granting permission to inhabit messy middle. Sattva-aligned: not self-deprecation (Tamas), not performance (Rajas), but authentic "here's what growth actually looks like." Antahkarana sequence: Chitta recalls → Mana generates → Aham witnesses → Buddhi shapes → Vyana shares. Success = reader feels less alone, not inspired to pity.

**Anti-Patterns (Explicit):**
- NO self-deprecation porn (Tamas wallowing)
- NO fishing for reassurance (Kama seeking)
- NO performative vulnerability (Dambha performing)
- NO comparing struggles (Matsarya competing)
- NO therapist couch (Moha oversharing)

**Core Question This Job Answers:**
"What did it *feel* like to build this week, in the moments when no one was watching?"

---

### **2. Schedule (Optimized for Dosha Cycles)**

**Current Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** `0 18 * * 5`
- **Timezone:** `Asia/Kolkata`
- **Frequency:** Weekly (Friday 6:00 PM)

**Proposed Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** `0 18 * * 5` (keep current)
- **Timezone:** `Asia/Kolkata` (canonical)
- **Frequency:** Weekly

**Dosha Alignment Check:**
- ✅ Vata window (2-6 PM) = optimal for communication/sharing
- ✅ Friday = natural weekly reflection point
- ✅ 1 hour post-digest = emotional processing time built in
- ✅ Not too late = avoids Kapha heaviness that might make sharing feel laborious

**Why Weekly, Not Daily:**
- Daily = too reactive, not enough Buddhi discernment time
- Weekly = sufficient distance for wisdom to emerge from experience
- Friday = symbolic week closure before weekend integration

---

### **3. Delivery Target**

**Channel:** Discord

**Target:** `#churned-content` (community-facing, curated authentic content)

**Delivery Constraints:**
- **Format:** Markdown-friendly (Discord supports basic markdown)
- **Length:** 300-500 words (readable in 2-3 minutes)
- **Tone:** Raw but not reckless, conversational, "texting a friend who gets it"
- **Attachments:** None required (text-only, optionally 1 image if contextually relevant)
- **No:** Markdown tables, complex formatting, embedded media avalanche

**Formatting Guidelines:**
- Use **bold** for emphasis, not CAPS
- Paragraph breaks for readability
- Optional emoji for tone (but not excessive)
- Links to context (e.g., digest post) wrapped in `<>` to suppress embeds if multiple links

---

### **4. Story Selection Algorithm**

**Input Sources (Prioritized):**

1. **Daily logs (`memory/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`):**
   - Search for emotional markers: "frustrated", "doubted", "almost gave up", "pivoted", "realized"
   - Weight recent entries higher (Thursday/Friday more relevant than Monday)

2. **Khalorēē tracking (`memory/kernel/OPENCLAW-KOSHA-TRACKING.md`):**
   - Look for energy crashes (Khalorēē drops >10 points)
   - Correlate crashes with log entries to find causation

3. **Discord build-digest output:**
   - What was publicly shared as "what happened"
   - BTS reveals "how it felt" — the gap between external narrative and internal experience

4. **Git commits (if accessible):**
   - Commit messages like "fix: desperation attempt" or "refactor: third try" = story gold
   - Times when multiple attempts visible = struggle narrative

**Selection Criteria (Buddhi Filter):**

**INCLUDE if:**
- ✅ Universally relatable ("I thought I broke everything and had to start over")
- ✅ Shows growth/learning ("Here's what I learned about X the hard way")
- ✅ Reveals human behind builder ("Spent 2 hours on a typo, felt ridiculous")
- ✅ Grants permission ("If you're struggling with X, you're not alone")
- ✅ Has resolution or acceptance ("Still don't know the answer, and that's okay")

**EXCLUDE if:**
- ❌ Too personal/private (therapeutic processing needed first)
- ❌ Blames others (not about accountability)
- ❌ Seeks reassurance ("Am I doing this right?")
- ❌ Performative suffering ("Look how hard my life is")
- ❌ No growth angle (just complaining)
- ❌ Would harm relationships (professional consequences)

**TMI Boundary Test:**
"If a stranger read this, would they think:
- A) 'Wow, relatable, I've felt that' ← INCLUDE
- B) 'Hmm, too much info' ← EXCLUDE"

**Algorithm Summary:**
```
FOR EACH day in past_week:
  emotional_entries = daily_logs.filter(has_emotional_marker)
  energy_crashes = khalori_tracking.filter(delta < -10)
  
FOR EACH potential_story:
  IF relatable AND growth_angle AND not_TMI:
    candidates.append(story)

SELECT top_candidate WHERE:
  - Most emotionally resonant
  - Best contrast with build-digest (external vs internal)
  - Hasn't been shared in similar form recently (no repetition)
  
SHAPE with Buddhi:
  - Strip victim language
  - Add growth insight
  - Keep under 500 words
```

---

### **5. Vulnerability Protocol**

**Phase 1: Aham Observes (Witness)**
- Notice emotional charge around potential story
- "I feel vulnerable sharing this" → Good signal, means it matters
- "I feel performative sharing this" → Bad signal, Dambha creeping in

**Phase 2: Buddhi Discerns Safety (Wisdom)**
- **Question 1:** "Will sharing this harm me?" (professional risk, privacy violation, trauma re-triggering)
  - If YES → Don't share, or wait until processed
- **Question 2:** "Will sharing this help others?"
  - If NO → Don't share, it's just catharsis
- **Question 3:** "Am I performing or being authentic?"
  - If performing → Rewrite in simpler language
- **Question 4:** "Would I want to read this?"
  - If NO → Don't send

**Phase 3: Mana Shapes Authentically (Expression)**
- Write as if texting a friend who gets it
- Use "I" statements, not "we" (don't assume reader experience)
- Name the emotion: "I felt scared", not "things were difficult"
- Show the mess: "I tried X, failed, tried Y, failed harder, then Z worked by accident"
- Add the insight: "What I learned: [one-sentence wisdom]"

**Phase 4: Vyana Distributes (Sharing)**
- Post to Discord #churned-content
- No explanation needed ("Here's this week's BTS" is enough)
- Don't monitor for reactions immediately (avoid reassurance-seeking)
- Trust that if it resonates, it resonates

**Red Flags (Abort Sharing):**
- Writing feels like confessional (seek therapy, not Discord)
- Desire to explain/justify in comments (means you're not ready)
- Hope for specific person to validate (private conversation needed instead)
- Shame lingers after writing (needs more processing)

### **7. Integration with discord-build-digest**

**Digest (5:00 PM) vs. BTS (6:00 PM) — Complementary Layers:**

| Aspect | Build-Digest (5:00 PM) | BTS (6:00 PM) |
|--------|------------------------|---------------|
| **Kosha** | Manomaya (what happened) | Vijnanamaya (what it meant) |
| **Vayu** | Vyana (distribution of facts) | Vyana (distribution of feeling) |
| **Tone** | Professional, polished | Raw, conversational |
| **Content** | Wins, outputs, progress | Doubts, pivots, almost-gave-up |
| **Audience lens** | "What did I ship?" | "How did it feel?" |
| **Muse** | Apollo (clarity, order) | Thalia + Melpomene (comedy + tragedy) |

**1-Hour Gap Purpose:**
- Allows emotional decompression from "doing" to "feeling"
- Digest = external narrative, BTS = internal reality
- Reader gets both: "Here's what I built" + "Here's what it cost"

**Cross-Reference Strategy:**
- BTS can reference digest: "In today's digest, I shared X. What I didn't say: [behind-the-scenes]"
- But BTS stands alone — reader doesn't need digest to understand BTS

**Why Not Combine Them?**
- Different Kosha layers (Manomaya vs Vijnanamaya) = different energies
- Digest needs professional tone for credibility
- BTS needs vulnerable tone for connection
- Mixing them dilutes both

---

### **2. Cross-References to Other Jobs**

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- `discord-build-digest` (5:00 PM Friday) provides "external narrative" context
- Daily logs accumulate all week, providing raw material

**Downstream Consumers:**
- None directly, but community responses may inform future digests

**Kosha Handoffs:**
- Manomaya (digest) → Vijnanamaya (BTS) → Manomaya (reader emotional resonance)

---

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

### **1. Pre-Deployment Testing**

**Smoke Test:**
- [ ] Manually run for one test cycle
- [ ] Verify story selection from daily logs
- [ ] Check Buddhi filter applied (no TMI)
- [ ] Confirm 300-500 word count
- [ ] Post to test Discord channel first

**Vikara Detection Test:**
- [ ] Deliberately write performative version → Confirm Dambha detected
- [ ] Deliberately write comparison version → Confirm Matsarya detected
- [ ] Deliberately write overly hedged version → Confirm Bhaya detected

---

### **2. 7-Day Monitoring**

**Week 1 Metrics:**
- **Execution:** Did it run Friday 6:00 PM?
- **Content:** Was story worth sharing? (retrospective self-review)
- **Community:** Any "me too" resonance responses?
- **Vikara:** Any afflictions detected in writing/delivery?
- **Khalorēē:** Net positive energy impact?

**Adjust After Week 1:**
- If too heavy → Add more Thalia (comedy)
- If too performative → Strip back language
- If too long → Tighten word count
- If no resonance → Revisit story selection algorithm

## 🔮 **Final Notes**

**Why This Job Matters:**
In a world of polished founder narratives and "crushing it" culture, this job is an act of rebellion. It says: "Here's what actually happens in the messy middle. Here's the doubt, the pivots, the almost-gave-up moments. And somehow, we keep going."

**The Gift:**
Not inspiration (that's cheap). Not pity (that's insulting). But permission — permission to be human while building, to struggle and still be worthy, to not have it figured out and keep trying anyway.

**Guardrail:**
If this ever starts feeling like performance art, kill it. Better to say nothing than to perform vulnerability. Sattva or silence.
