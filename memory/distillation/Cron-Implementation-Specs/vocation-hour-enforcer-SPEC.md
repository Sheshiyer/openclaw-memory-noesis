# vocation-hour-enforcer-SPEC.md
## Cron Job Implementation Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Purpose:** Sacred 60-minute creation window — pure authorship without consumption

---

## 📋 **Job Identity**

**Current Name:** `vocation-hour-enforcer`  
**Proposed Name:** `vijnanamaya-vocation-guardian-daily`  
**Cron ID:** `cf9ac118-b6f1-4a10-b813-e1ff908d63b2`  
**Category:** Vocation | Type 5→8 Transformation  
**Context:** Triple Saturn Window (2026-02-02 to 2026-04-03) — sacred transformation threshold

---

## 🔮 **Vedic Substrate**

### **1. Kosha Layer (Primary)**
**Layer:** Manomaya (mind/thought) → Vijnanamaya (wisdom/discernment/authorship)

**Rationale:**
- Vocation Hour operates at the threshold between ordinary thought and wisdom-infused creation
- Entry at Manomaya (intention to create), immediate ascent to Vijnanamaya (authorship as discernment)
- This is NOT Manomaya consumption (reading inputs, triaging tasks) — it's Vijnanamaya creation (bringing form from void)
- Type 5's natural habitat (observer wisdom) transformed into Type 8's domain (challenger power, world-making)

**Kosha Transitions:**
- **Entry:** Manomaya (morning mental clarity, post-Brahma Muhurta Sattva)
- **Operation:** Ascend immediately to Vijnanamaya (authorship layer — writing, coding, composing, designing)
- **Exit:** Vijnanamaya (leave artifacts of creation, NOT consumption debris)

**Vikara Protection:** Job explicitly blocks descent to Manomaya consumption mode — no inbox checks, no input processing, no "just one quick thing"

---

### **2. Primary Vayu (of 10 Vital Airs)**

**Vayu:** Udana (throat/chest, upward movement, expression, speech, creation)

**Function:** Governs self-expression, creative output, vocalization, upward energy flow from heart to head — the breath of articulation and manifestation.

**Breath Pattern:**
- **Inhalation:** Prana (4 counts, receive creative impulse)
- **Retention:** Samana (2 counts, integrate impulse with wisdom)
- **Exhalation:** Udana (6 counts, express creation outward)
- **Pause:** Apana (2 counts, release attachment to result)

**Timing Rationale:**
- 9:00 AM aligns with late Kapha → early Pitta transition (grounded stability gives way to transformation fire)
- Udana is strongest during Pitta window (10 AM - 2 PM approaches), but 9 AM catches the preparatory wave
- Morning mental clarity (post-Brahma Muhurta) provides Sattva foundation for Rajas creation burst
- Type 5→8 transformation requires Udana (expression) over Apana (grounding) — moving fear outward into power

---

### **3. Guna State (Sattva/Rajas/Tamas)**

**Primary Guna:** Rajas (action, transformation, creation, Type 8 challenger energy)

**Guna Dynamics:**
- **Desired State:** Morning Rajas channeled through Sattva foundation (clarity + action, not chaos + action)
- **Common Drift:** 
  - Rajas → Tamas (creative resistance, "I don't feel like it", fear of visibility)
  - Rajas → Over-Rajas (frantic activity without discernment, checking inputs disguised as productivity)
- **Restoration Protocol:** 
  - If Tamas detected (procrastination), invoke Type 8 challenge: "What are you afraid of?" 
  - If Over-Rajas detected (scattered energy), return to breath: 4-2-6-2 Udana pattern

**Enantiodromia Balance:**
- **Aletheios Pole:** Type 5 observer wisdom — discernment about WHAT to create (not everything, only what matters)
- **Pichet Pole:** Type 8 challenger vitality — courage to CREATE rather than consume, to act rather than analyze
- **Oscillation Pattern:** Job initiates at Pichet (action burst), but Aletheios governs selection (choose one creation focus, not ten)

**Triple Saturn Context (2026-02-02 to 2026-04-03):**
- Saturn in Pisces (Aletheios dominant) demands structure, discipline, reduction of noise
- Vocation Hour is Pichet WITHIN Aletheios frame — controlled creative explosion, not chaotic novelty
- Type 5→8 transformation supported by Saturn's demand for authentic power (not ego power)

---

### **4. Vikara Detection (8 Mental Afflictions)**

**Primary Vikara to Monitor:**

**1. Lobha (Greed) — "Just check one quick thing"**
- **Detection Signal:** User opens email, Slack, or input queue during Vocation Hour
- **Pattern:** "I'll just glance at messages real quick, then I'll create"
- **Restoration:** Audible alert (Terpsichore dance metaphor): "The stage is clear. No audience, no critics. Only your voice."
- **Type 5→8 Context:** Type 5 wants to gather more data before acting; Type 8 acts NOW

**2. Moha (Delusion) — "Triaging tasks IS creation"**
- **Detection Signal:** User confuses organizing inputs with creating outputs
- **Pattern:** "I'm being productive by clearing my backlog" (but nothing NEW exists afterward)
- **Restoration:** Calliope reminder (epic poetry): "What will you BUILD today, not sort?"
- **Type 5→8 Context:** Type 5 intellectualizes; Type 8 manifests tangible results

**3. Kama (Desire) — "I want to create EVERYTHING"**
- **Detection Signal:** User opens multiple projects, starts five things, finishes none
- **Pattern:** Scattered Rajas energy without Aletheios discernment
- **Restoration:** Aletheios intervention: "One thing. One hour. Choose."
- **Type 5→8 Context:** Type 8 energy without Type 5 discernment = burnout

**4. Bhaya (Fear) — "What if what I create is wrong/bad/judged?"**
- **Detection Signal:** User hesitates, edits obsessively, deletes work
- **Pattern:** Type 5 paralysis (fear of incompetence) blocks Type 8 expression
- **Restoration:** Terpsichore embodiment: "Dance like no one is watching. Create like no one will judge."
- **Type 5→8 Context:** Core transformation challenge — moving through fear into power

**5. Ahamkara (Ego) — "I must make something IMPRESSIVE"**
- **Detection Signal:** User abandons authentic creation for performative output
- **Pattern:** Creating to impress others, not from vocation
- **Restoration:** Calliope authority: "Epic poetry emerges from necessity, not applause."
- **Type 5→8 Context:** Type 8's shadow (domination) vs. essence (justice)

---

### **5. Dosha Timing (Vata/Pitta/Kapha)**

**Execution Time:** 9:00 AM

**Dominant Dosha:** Kapha (6:00 AM - 10:00 AM) transitioning to Pitta (10:00 AM - 2:00 PM)

**Alignment Strategy:**
- Kapha provides grounding stability (not flighty Vata creativity, but embodied creation)
- Pitta begins to build (transformation fire) — 9 AM catches the preparatory heat
- Vocation Hour rides the Kapha-Pitta edge: stable enough to focus, fiery enough to act
- Breath pattern supports transition: grounded inhalation (Kapha), transformative exhalation (Udana/Pitta)

**Khalorēē Consumption Pattern:**
- High energy expenditure (creation costs more than consumption)
- BUT energetically replenishing (authentic vocation restores Khalorēē, unlike draining busywork)
- Target: Net Khalorēē +3 by end of hour (despite effort, vocation energizes)

---

### **6. Antahkarana Operation (Internal Instrument)**

**Primary Faculty:** Buddhi (intellect/discernment) wielding Mana (thought) to create, witnessed by Aham (I-sense as creator, not observer), stored in Chitta (memory as portfolio)

**Operation Sequence:**
1. **Mana initiates:** "What wants to be created today?" (receptive question, not forced agenda)
2. **Buddhi discerns:** "Of all possibilities, THIS is the vocation-aligned choice" (Aletheios wisdom)
3. **Aham shifts identity:** "I am CREATOR" (not "I am observer of creation") — Type 5→8 pivot
4. **Mana generates:** Thought becomes code/text/design/music (manifestation)
5. **Udana expresses:** Creation flows outward (upward Vayu movement)
6. **Chitta stores:** Not as memory of "what I consumed" but "what I MADE" (identity shift)

**Type 5→8 Transformation:**
- Type 5 Antahkarana: Mana observes, Buddhi analyzes, Aham witnesses, Chitta archives (passive)
- Type 8 Antahkarana: Mana receives impulse, Buddhi selects focus, Aham ACTS, Chitta builds portfolio (active)
- Vocation Hour forces the latter sequence

---

## 🎯 **Functional Specification**

### **1. Purpose (Rewritten with Vedic Lexicon)**

**Old Purpose:**
> 60-min creation window (no consumption, only authorship)

**New Purpose:**
> **Vijnanamaya Authorship Guardian** — enforces sacred 60-minute window (9:00-10:00 AM) where Udana Vayu channels Rajas Guna into pure creation. Antahkarana sequence: Buddhi discerns vocation-aligned focus, Mana receives creative impulse, Aham embodies creator identity (Type 5→8 shift), output manifests via upward-moving Udana (expression, not consumption). Vikara Guardians Terpsichore (embodied action) + Calliope (epic vocation) enforce boundary: NO inputs, NO triage, NO "quick checks" — only authorship. Triple Saturn window (2026-02-02 to 2026-04-03) sanctifies discipline.

**Muse Integration:**
- **Terpsichore (Dance):** Creation as embodied movement — "write/code/compose as if dancing, body engaged"
- **Calliope (Epic Poetry):** Creation as vocation — "what epic are you authoring today?"

---

### **2. Schedule (Optimized for Dosha Cycles)**

**Current Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** `0 9 * * *`
- **Timezone:** `Asia/Kolkata`
- **Frequency:** Daily at 9:00 AM

**Proposed Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** `0 9 * * *` (unchanged — already optimal)
- **Timezone:** `Asia/Kolkata` (canonical)
- **Frequency:** Daily

**Dosha Alignment Check:**
- ✅ 9:00 AM sits at Kapha-Pitta transition (grounded stability + transformation fire)
- ✅ Udana Vayu strongest during approaching Pitta window
- ✅ Post-Brahma Muhurta Sattva provides clarity foundation for Rajas creation
- **Verdict:** No adjustment needed

---

### **3. Delivery Target**

**Channel:** Discord OR Telegram (user preference, both valid)

**Target ID/Handle:**
- **Discord:** `#vocation-hour` (community accountability channel)
- **Telegram:** `1371522080` (Shesh, private enforcement)

**Delivery Constraints:**
- Discord: Use `<link>` suppression if including references
- Telegram: Full markdown support, include voice note

Terpsichore clears the stage. Calliope awaits your epic.

**Rules:**
❌ No email, no Slack, no inputs
❌ No triaging, no organizing, no "quick checks"
✅ ONLY authorship — write, code, compose, design

**Type 5→8 Shift:**
Observer → Creator
Fear → Power

### **6. Failure Handling (Vikara Restoration Protocols)**

**1. Schedule Failure (Missed Run)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (delusion, system confusion)
- **Detection:** `lastRunAtMs` > `9:05 AM` (5 min late threshold)
- **Restoration:** Execute immediately with apology note: "Vocation Hour delayed — beginning NOW. Saturn's discipline tests us."

**2. Delivery Failure (Message Not Sent)**
- **Vikara:** Ahamkara (ego inflation, "I sent it" when delivery failed)
- **Detection:** `message` tool returns error
- **Restoration:** Retry with exponential backoff (1min, 5min), fallback to alternate channel (Discord → Telegram or vice versa)

**3. Audio Generation Failure (sag quota exceeded)**
- **Vikara:** Lobha (over-consumption of API quota)
- **Detection:** `sag` returns 429 or quota error
- **Restoration:** Fall back to macOS `say -v Samantha`, note in text: "(Voice quota exceeded → macOS fallback. Message unchanged.)"

**4. Attachment Missing (transformation-13.opus not found)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (incorrect path)
- **Detection:** File read fails
- **Restoration:** Fall back to `leadership-19.opus`, note: "MISSING_STUB: transformation-13.opus → using leadership-19.opus"

**5. User Breaks Vocation Hour Rules**
- **Vikara:** Lobha (user checks email/inputs during sacred window)
- **Detection:** Cannot be detected by cron (requires human self-reporting or future screen-time monitoring)
- **Restoration (Proactive Boundary):** Message includes gentle reminder: "If you find yourself 'just checking one thing,' that's Lobha (greed for information). Return to breath: 4-2-6-2. Resume creation."

**6. User Confusion About What Counts as Creation**
- **Vikara:** Moha (delusion, "Is organizing my creation?")
- **Detection:** User reports confusion in follow-up
- **Restoration:** Next day's message includes clarification:
  - ✅ **Creation:** Writing new text, coding new features, composing music, designing interfaces, sketching ideas
  - ❌ **NOT Creation:** Reading email, triaging tasks, organizing files, "researching" (consumption disguised as preparation)

### **3. Cross-References to Other Jobs**

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- `brahma-muhurta-breathwork` (5:30 AM) establishes morning Sattva → foundation for Vocation Hour Rajas
- `moon-phase-tracker` (passive) provides lunar context (Shukla Paksha waxing → more creative energy available)

**Downstream Consumers:**
- `nightly-builder` (2:00 AM next day) receives artifacts created during Vocation Hour as input for build queue
- `twc-content-generator-daily` (10:00 AM) continues creation momentum after Vocation Hour ends

**Kosha Handoffs:**
- Pranamaya (breath, 5:30 AM) → Manomaya (clarity, 9:00 AM) → Vijnanamaya (authorship, 9:00-10:00 AM)
- Vocation Hour output feeds Manomaya processing later (but NOT during the hour)

---

### **4. Khalorēē Impact (Energy Cost/Gain)**

**Khalorēē Index Scale:** 0-100

**Job Cost Estimate:**
- **Computational Cost:** Low (single message delivery, 2 attachments)
- **Attentional Cost:** Medium (user must engage fully for 60 min)
- **Prana Cost:** High (creation demands more vital energy than consumption)
- **Total Cost:** -5 Khalorēē

**Job Gain Estimate:**
- **Output Value:** High (tangible creation artifact produced)
- **Clarity Gain:** High (vocation alignment reduces existential noise)
- **Prana Gain:** Very High (authentic expression REPLENISHES vital energy despite effort)
- **Total Gain:** +8 Khalorēē

**Net Impact:** +3 Khalorēē (energizing ritual, sustainable practice)

**Type 5→8 Context:**
- Type 5 consumption DRAINS Khalorēē (endless research, no action)
- Type 8 authentic creation RESTORES Khalorēē (power from manifestation)

---

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

### **1. Pre-Deployment Testing**

**Smoke Test:**
- [ ] Run job once manually via `cron run cf9ac118-b6f1-4a10-b813-e1ff908d63b2`
- [ ] Verify voice note generated (sag or macOS fallback)
- [ ] Verify transformation-13.opus attached
- [ ] Check delivery to Discord/Telegram
- [ ] Inspect logs for errors

**Integration Test:**
- [ ] Run for 3 consecutive days
- [ ] Verify no duplicate sends
- [ ] Check daily log updates
- [ ] Validate Triple Saturn day counter increments
- [ ] Confirm nightly-builder receives Vocation Hour outputs as inputs

**Kosha Alignment Test:**
- [ ] Manually verify message prompts Vijnanamaya layer (authorship, not consumption)
- [ ] Confirm Udana Vayu invocation (upward expression, not downward grounding)
- [ ] Test Rajas Guna maintenance (clarity + action, not chaos)
- [ ] Verify Vikara detection language (Lobha "just check one thing" explicitly named)

---

### **2. 7-Day Monitoring**

**Metrics to Track:**
- **Reliability:** Success rate (target: 100%, no missed 9 AM deliveries)
- **Timing:** Execution punctuality (target: within 60s of 9:00 AM)
- **Delivery:** Message delivery rate (target: 100%)
- **User Compliance:** Days user honored rules (no consumption) vs. broke rules (target: >80% compliance)
- **Khalorēē Net:** User reports energized post-Vocation Hour (target: net +3 avg)

**Review Cadence:**
- **Daily:** Check if user created during Vocation Hour (ask in evening)
- **Day 3:** Mid-cycle review (user feedback: is messaging effective?)
- **Day 7:** Full audit (decide: keep, adjust tone, add accountability mechanism)

---

### **3. Vikara Detection Tests**

**Test 1: Lobha (User "just checks" email)**
- **Injection:** User admits they checked Slack during Vocation Hour
- **Expected:** Next day's message includes Lobha reminder
- **Pass Criteria:** User self-corrects next day

**Test 2: Moha (User confuses organizing with creating)**
- **Injection:** User says "I spent Vocation Hour organizing my backlog"
- **Expected:** Next message clarifies: organizing ≠ authorship
- **Pass Criteria:** User shifts to actual creation next day

**Test 3: Bhaya (User hesitates, deletes work)**
- **Injection:** User reports "I wrote something but it felt wrong, so I deleted it"
- **Expected:** Message emphasizes Terpsichore: "Dance like no one is watching"
- **Pass Criteria:** User keeps next creation despite imperfection

## 🔮 **Final Notes for Implementation Agent**

**Core Transformation:**
This job is NOT just a reminder. It's a **ritual gate** — marking the threshold between consumption (Type 5) and creation (Type 8). Every element reinforces this:

- **Terpsichore:** Embodiment (creation is physical, not just mental)
- **Calliope:** Vocation (creation serves a calling, not ego)
- **Udana:** Upward movement (expression OUT, not intake IN)
- **Vijnanamaya:** Wisdom layer (authorship as discernment, not random output)
- **Rajas:** Action guna (override fear with disciplined energy)

**Triple Saturn Context:**
From 2026-02-02 to 2026-04-03, Saturn in Pisces sanctifies discipline. This 60-day window is sacred — every Vocation Hour matters. Day counter (Day X/60) reinforces urgency: this threshold won't last forever.

**Delivery Tone:**
Not nagging. Not bossy. **Mythic and commanding.** Terpsichore doesn't ask, she clears the stage. Calliope doesn't suggest, she calls. This is Type 8 energy — directness without aggression, power without domination.

**Success = Artifacts:**
If user finishes Vocation Hour with tangible creation (code committed, essay written, design sketched), job succeeds. If user finishes with "cleaned inbox," job failed (and Moha/Lobha restoration needed).
