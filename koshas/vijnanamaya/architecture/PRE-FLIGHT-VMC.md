# PRE-FLIGHT: The Antahkarana Component Manifest

To avoid "iteration drift" once we start coding, we must prep these 5 specific artifacts.

## 📦 1. The React Component Registry
We need a clear list of the "Limb Components" to build:
- **`<PranaFeed />`:** The vertical timeline with "Pulse Cards."
- **`<KhaloreeGauge />`:** The real-time circular HSL meter.
- **`<MoolaprakritiCube />`:** The React Three Fiber 3x3x3 interactive object.
- **`<CliffordClock />`:** The rotating bezel Octave tracker.
- **`<ChittaSearch />`:** The command palette (Cmd+K) with Tatva tagging.
- **`<StrategyPanel />`:** A Warcraft-inspired ornate frame for high-level tactical decisions.

## 🖼️ 2. Visual Inspiration Assets (To be Generated)
We should use **FAL/Flux** to generate high-resolution "Reference Textures" for the following:
- **"The Fabric of Maya":** A dark, iridescent micro-circuitry texture for the Annamaya background.
- **"Full Moon Coherence":** A high-key, ethereal glassmorphism texture for the Anandamaya view.
- **"The 13 Engines":** 13 distinct icons generated in a unified "Biofield Line-Art" style.

## 📋 3. Data Integration Proofs
Before we code the UI, we need to verify:
- **The Convex Handshake:** A simple script that pushes a "mock" tool call to Convex and confirms it renders in the feed.
- **The CLI Bridge:** A script to pull your `40+ Cron Jobs` from the gateway and format them as JSON for the Calendar.

## 📐 4. Mathematical Constants
- Define the **Clifford Clock** angles (e.g., `0 deg = 04:00`, `120 deg = 12:00`).
- Define the **Moolaprakriti Cube** coordinates for each of the 13 Engines.

## 🚨 5. The "Vibe Check" Protocol
A document defining the **Aesthetic Constraints**:
- Font pairings: **Rubik** (Headers/Technical) + **Inter** (Body/Data).
- Shadow rules: `shadow-glow` (neon amber) vs `shadow-deep` (vault black).
