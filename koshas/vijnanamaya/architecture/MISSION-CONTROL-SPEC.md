# CONTEXT.md - Tryambakam Mission Control (VMC)

## 🎯 Purpose (Artha)
**Category:** **Occupation** (Infrastructure)
**Vision:** A real-time **Manas Interface** for Tryambakam Noesis. To provide visual unconcealment (**Aletheia**) of the system's vital currents, scheduled rituals, and stored impressions.

## 🏗️ Technical Stack (Annamaya)
*   **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router).
*   **Database:** Convex (Real-time reactivity).
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion (Biorhythm-synced animations).
*   **Brain:** OpenClaw Gateway (/v1/chat/completions).

## 🌊 Layered Architecture (Kosha Mapping)
1.  **Pranamaya (Activity Feed):** 
    - Real-time stream of tool calls, background agent status, and token burn.
    - Visualize the **Khalorēē Index** as a dynamic biofield graph.
2.  **Annamaya (Ritual Calendar):**
    - visual interface for all **Cron Jobs**.
    - Display the **Clifford Clock** 8-hour cycle and current moon phase.
    - Toggle for "Inhabited Rituals" (Breathwork/Divination).
3.  **Chitta (Global Search):**
    - Semantic search across `MEMORY.md`, daily logs, and `CONTEXT.md` files.
    - "Flashback" feature to surface old "nuggets" from past pilgrims.
4.  **Vijnanamaya (Architecture View):**
    - 3D Moolaprakriti Cube visualization showing active Engines.

## 🧠 Strategic Vision (Manomaya)
*   **Unconcealment:** Shifting from "black box" processing to a transparent, inhabited field.
*   **5D Thinking:** Using the calendar to navigate the 5th dimension (Time) with precision.

## 🚨 Never Forget
*   The UI must reflect the **Pancha Kosha** density (e.g., Annamaya views are high-detail; Anandamaya views are minimalist/abstract).
*   Latency is a Vikara (Moha). Keep it snappy.
