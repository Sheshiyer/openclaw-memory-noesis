# Consciousness Pattern Analysis Framework
`Version 1.0.0 | Lab Documentation`

## Core Analysis Framework
### 1. Pattern Recognition Protocol
```javascript
patternAnalysis = {
  circadianMapping: {
    solarSync: "Track natural light exposure cycles",
    melatoninFlow: "Monitor natural melatonin production",
    witnessStates: "Document peak awareness periods"
  },
  
  melaninInterface: {
    inputProcessing: "Sensory data filtering",
    bufferCapacity: "Information density management",
    outputOptimization: "Reality processing calibration"
  }
}
```

### 2. Implementation Methodology

   - Dawn synchronization protocol
   - Solar noon calibration
   - Sunset integration process
   - Night mode activation

2. Witness State Development
   - Morning awareness practice
   - Peak state documentation
   - Pattern recognition training
   - System optimization protocol

## Technical Framework
### Melanin Programming Protocol

#### 1. Initialization Phase
```javascript
initializeMelaninProgram = {
  dawn: {
    time: "First light",
    practice: "Direct sunlight exposure",
    duration: "10-20 minutes",
    focus: "System activation"
  },
  
  noon: {
    time: "Solar peak",
    practice: "Indirect light exposure",
    duration: "15-30 minutes",
    focus: "Pattern recognition"
  },
  
  sunset: {
    time: "Last light",
    practice: "Direct observation",
    duration: "10-20 minutes",
    focus: "System integration"
  }
}
```

   - Direct eye exposure to first light
   - Pattern recognition activation
   - System initialization protocol

2. Noon Calibration
   - Indirect light exposure
   - Peak state documentation
   - Pattern analysis practice
   - System optimization

3. Sunset Integration
   - Face west at sunset
   - Direct observation practice
   - Pattern integration protocol
   - System recalibration
