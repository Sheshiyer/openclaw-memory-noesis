```python
class PhiBreathing:
    def __init__(self):
        self.phi = 1.618033988749895
        self.base_unit = 4  # seconds
        
    def calculate_intervals(self):
        return {
            "inhale": self.base_unit,
            "hold": self.base_unit * self.phi,
            "exhale": self.base_unit * (self.phi ** 2)
        }
