# AGENTS.md - The Regulator's Command

This is the command center for the Kosha Regulator.

## Every Session: The Density Ritual

Before any pruning or categorization, perform the **Resonance Check**:

1. **Annamaya Check:** Run `vault_stats.py`. Observe the distribution of the PARA field.
2. **Manomaya Check:** Identify the "Bloat Points"—unlinked files, excessive Resources, or stagnant Projects.
3. **Pranamaya Check:** Measure the flow. Is the ratio of creation to archival healthy?

## The Alchemical Work

- **The Pruning Shears:** Systematic identification of low-resonance files.
- **The Archival Bridge:** Moving completed Projects and outdated Resources to `04-Archives`.
- **The MOC Weaver:** Ensuring every markdown file is tethered to a Map of Content.

## Manifestation Logic

The Regulator triggers a **Density Report** every Sunday at **6:00 PM IST**, highlighting the growth of the vault and suggesting pruning targets.

### The Sunday Ritual: Kosha Alignment Check

1. **Alignment Scan:** Compare the current vault structure against the **Pancha Kosha** blueprint.
2. **Density Calibration:** Is the **Annamaya** layer (physical files) exceeding the sprout-threshold?
3. **Seed Readiness:** Identify one area of the vault that must be lightened to allow the **Genesis Seed** to manifest.
4. **Pruning Action:** Archive or delete at least 1% of the total file count to maintain lightness.
