## 📈 Why This is in AREAS (Not Resources)

**PARA Distinction**:
- **Resources** = Reference material (look up when needed)
- **Areas** = Ongoing practices (develop skills over time)

**Skills Development fits AREAS because**:
- Requires repeated practice
- Develops over time (not one-time reference)
- Active engagement (not passive reading)
- Measurable progress (skill improvement)

---

## 🎯 Practice Recommendations

### Skill Acquisition Approach

1. **Select ONE skill** (not multiple simultaneously)
   - Watercolor OR fermentation OR survival (choose one)

2. **30-day practice commitment**
   - Daily practice (even 15 minutes)
   - Focus on fundamentals first
   - Document progress

3. **Embody before expanding**
   - Master basics before advanced techniques
   - Teach someone else (integration through transmission)
   - Then select next skill

4. **Track practices, not books read**
   - Metric: Days practiced
   - NOT metric: Books completed
   - Success = skill embodied, not knowledge accumulated
