## 💡 Why This Integration Matters

**Before integration**:
- Books and papers separate
- Difficult to connect cultivation → clinical outcomes
- Incomplete knowledge spectrum

**After integration**:
- 465 resources connected
- Complete spectrum: cultivation → consumption → clinical
- Books provide protocols, papers provide evidence
- **Actionable + evidence-based**

**This is the model for cross-collection integration.**
