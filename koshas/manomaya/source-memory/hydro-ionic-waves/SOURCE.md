## 📋 Document Summary

A presentation proposing that:
1. Neural and biofield signaling involves **hydro-ionic waves** beyond conventional nerve impulses
2. These waves have **music-like properties** (rhythm, frequency, consonance)
3. **Protein sequences** can be transcribed into musical patterns
4. External signals mimicking biological patterns can elicit biological effects
5. **Chladni-like patterns** may form in biological tissues from sound
