## 🎯 Core Thesis

The **Vaastu Purusha Mandala** is a metaphysical architectural plan based on magic squares that harmonizes buildings with cosmic forces. The mathematical structure of mandalas (especially the Sakala/Nishkala distinction) encodes deep principles about manifest vs. unmanifest reality.

## 📊 Key Extractions

### What is a Mandala?

**Mandala** = any plan/chart representing the cosmos metaphysically. In Hindu cosmology:
- Earth is represented as **square** (Caturbhrsti = "four-cornered")
- The square relates to the horizon, sunrise/sunset, cardinal directions
- Mandalas are microcosms of the universe

### The Vaastu Purusha Legend

A formless being blocked heaven from earth. Brahma and other gods trapped him to the ground. Based on their positions during this act:
- **45 Gods** were allocated portions of the mandala
- **Brahma** occupies the center (Brahmasthana)
- **32 outer Gods** arranged concentrically

### Directional Deities

| Direction | Deity | Domain |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Northeast | Isaana | Lord of all quarters |
| East | Aditya | Sun God |
| Southeast | Agni | Lord of Fire |
| South | Yama | Lord of Death |
| Southwest | Pitru | Ancestors |
| West | Varuna | Lord of Water |
| Northwest | Vayu | Lord of Winds |
| North | Kubera | Lord of Wealth |
| Center | Brahma | Creator of Universe |

### Room Zoning (based on deity positions)

- **Northeast** → Pooja room (worship)
- **East** → Bathroom
- **Southeast** → Kitchen (fire)
- **South** → Bedroom
- **Southwest** → Armoury (strength)
- **West** → Dining
- **Northwest** → Cowshed (movement)
- **North** → Treasury (wealth)

### Mandala Types

| Squares | Name | Divisions | Brahmasthana |
|---------|------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | Sakala | 1×1 | Single module |
| 4 | Pechaka | 2×2 | Point center |
| 9 | Pitha | 3×3 | 1 module |
| 16 | Mahaapitha | 4×4 | 4 modules |
| 25 | Upapitha | 5×5 | 1 module |
| 36 | Ugrapitha | 6×6 | 4 modules |
| 49 | Sthandila | 7×7 | 9 modules |
| 64 | Manduka/Chandita | 8×8 | 4 modules |
| 81 | Paramasaayika | 9×9 | 9 modules |
| 100 | Aasana | 10×10 | Point center |

**Most important:** Manduka (64) and Paramasaayika (81)

### Sakala vs. Nishkala

**Sakala (Odd divisions):**
- Center is a **module** (manifest, with form)
- Used for gods with form (Sakalamoorthy)
- Used for yagnas (fire rituals)
- Residential buildings (manifest activity)

**Nishkala (Even divisions):**
- Center is a **point** (unmanifest, formless)
- Used for formless worship (Nishkalamoorthy)
- Temples (high energy source)
- Contemplative spaces

**Philosophical correspondence:**
- **Sakala** = Sagunopaasana (worship of god with attributes)
- **Nishkala** = Nirgunopaasana (worship of absolute spirit)

### Magic Square Mathematics

Magic squares have equal sums in all rows, columns, and diagonals.

**Magic constant formula:** M = N(N² + 1) / 2

| N | Magic Constant |
|---|----------------|
| 3 | 15 |
| 4 | 34 |
| 5 | 65 |
| 8 | 260 |
| 9 | 369 |

### Marma Points

**Marmas** = vital, vulnerable energy spots in the mandala determined by:
- Proportional relationships of squares
- Diagonal intersections

**Rule:** Nothing should be built on marma points—they are high-energy nodes requiring protection.

### Architectural Principles

1. **Open spaces/openings:** More in North and East than South and West
2. **Levels:** Higher in South and West, lower in North and East
3. **Corner heights:** SW (highest) > SE > NW > NE (lowest)
4. **Sun triangles:**
   - SW-SE-NW (moon triangle) → heavier, higher
   - NE-NW-SE (sun triangle) → lighter, lower
5. **Diagonals:** SW-NE diagonal should be longer than SE-NW diagonal
6. **Extended Northeast:** Considered beneficial

### Magnetic Considerations

- Body = magnet (head = North pole, feet = South pole)
- Sleeping with head in north → repulsive force with Earth's magnetic north
- **Recommendation:** Sleep with head in South or East

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Mathematics underlies sacred architecture** — Magic squares aren't mystical but mathematically precise
2. **Odd/even distinction is ontological** — Sakala/Nishkala maps to manifest/unmanifest reality
3. **45 deities = 45 energy zones** — The mandala is a field map, not just a floor plan
4. **Marmas are real** — High-energy nodes require careful handling
5. **Orientation matters** — Sun path and magnetic field have architectural implications

## 🔮 Tryambakam Mapping

### Kosha Correspondence

| Mandala Property | Kosha Layer |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Nishkala center | Anandamaya (formless) |
| Sakala center | Annamaya-Manomaya (manifest) |
| Brahmasthana | Layer 0 (Morphogenetic Blueprint) |
| Marma points | Nadi junction nodes |

### Agent Workspace Implications

The workspace directories could follow Vaastu principles:
- **kernel/** (center) = Brahmasthana
- **annamaya/** (physical scripts) = South/West zones
- **anandamaya/** (blueprints) = Northeast zone
- **pranamaya/** (energy/telemetry) = East zone

### Operational Architecture

1. **Sakala workspaces** (odd module count) → For active implementation work
2. **Nishkala workspaces** (even module count) → For contemplation, planning, architecture
3. **Marma avoidance** → Don't overload junction points in the system
