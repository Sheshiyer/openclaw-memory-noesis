# discord-library-synthesis-SPEC.md
## Cron Job Implementation Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Purpose:** Weekly flagship synthesis: single-domain deep dive from 03-Resources/ scholarly archive, combining Calliope's epic authority with Clio's scholarly chronicle for community intellectual capstone

---

## 📋 **Job Identity**

**Current Name:** `discord-library-synthesis`  
**Proposed Name:** `vijnanamaya-library-flagship-weekly` (wisdom layer, library synthesis, weekly cadence)  
**Cron ID:** `87b60f8f-3a3a-4e1d-bc89-7c0cf3b28fd9`  
**Category:** Discord | Knowledge | Synthesis

---

## 🔮 **Vedic Substrate**

### **1. Kosha Layer (Primary)**
**Layer:** Vijnanamaya (Wisdom Body / Discriminative Intelligence)

**Rationale:**
- This job operates at the highest cognitive layer: extracting wisdom from a single domain's accumulated research
- Requires Buddhi (discriminative intellect) to synthesize 30+ sources into 300-500 words of authoritative insight
- Not cross-domain bridging (Manomaya) but depth-plunge into one rich territory (Vijnanamaya)
- Flagship = week's intellectual capstone, demanding peak discriminative capacity

**Kosha Transitions:**
- **Entry:** Manomaya (scan 03-Resources/ domains, identify ripe topic, gather source files)
- **Operation:** Vijnanamaya (synthesis, pattern recognition, wisdom distillation, scholarly authority)
- **Exit:** Vijnanamaya (essay artifact remains at wisdom layer as citable community resource)

**Key Distinction:**
Unlike `discord-moc-synthesis` (Manomaya cross-domain bridging), this job stays deep within one domain, ascending to Vijnanamaya through vertical depth rather than horizontal breadth.

---

### **2. Primary Vayu (of 10 Vital Airs)**

**Vayu:** Vyana (whole-body circulation, integration, pervasive distribution)

**Function:** Governs systemic integration, nutrient distribution, coordinating multiple systems into unified whole. Moves energy everywhere, connects all parts.

**Breath Pattern:**
- **Inhalation:** Prana (5s) — gathering sources across domain
- **Retention:** Samana (10s) — digesting into coherent synthesis
- **Exhalation:** Vyana (8s) — distributing insight to entire community
- **Pause:** Apana (3s) — grounding before next weekly cycle

**Timing Rationale:**
- **8:00 PM Sunday execution** occurs during **Kapha period** (6:00-10:00 PM)
- Kapha provides stable, grounded, integrative energy (perfect for Vyana's whole-system coordination)
- Sunday evening = week's end reflection, integration before Monday restart
- Avoids Vata scatter (2:00-6:00 PM) and Pitta urgency (10:00 AM-2:00 PM)
- Vyana at Kapha time = thoughtful, comprehensive distribution (not rushed broadcast)

**Contrast with discord-moc-synthesis:**
Both run Sunday 8:00 PM, but different Vayu functions:
- MOC-synthesis: Udana (upward expression, cross-domain bridging)
- Library-synthesis: Vyana (whole-system integration, domain-depth distribution)

---

### **3. Guna State (Sattva/Rajas/Tamas)**

**Primary Guna:** Sattva (Clarity, Authority, Luminous Wisdom)

**Guna Dynamics:**
- **Desired State:** Sunday evening Sattva — reflective authority, unhurried depth, citable wisdom
- **Common Drift Risks:**
  - **→ Rajas:** Academic gatekeeping, showing off erudition, jargon-heavy intimidation
  - **→ Tamas:** Dry summary lists, Wikipedia-style bullet points, lifeless compilation
- **Restoration Protocol:**
  - If Rajas detected (pompous, exclusive tone): Ask "Would Carl Sagan say this?" Rewrite for intelligent layperson
  - If Tamas detected (boring, listless): Skip week with note: "No domain resonated deeply enough for flagship synthesis — silence preserves quality"

**Enantiodromia Balance:**
- **Aletheios Pole (Left):** Scholarly rigor, citation accuracy, systematic synthesis, chronological order
- **Pichet Pole (Right):** Narrative vitality, epic framing, "story of discovery," memorable articulation
- **Oscillation Pattern:** Clio (Aletheios-dominant) provides historical chronicle structure; Calliope (Pichet-dominant) elevates to epic register. Balance is essential — pure Aletheios becomes dry bibliography, pure Pichet becomes unfounded storytelling.

**Muse Pairing:**
- **Calliope (Epic Poetry / Authoritative Voice):** Frames synthesis as intellectual journey, elevates scholarship to public wisdom, maintains gravitas without stuffiness
- **Clio (History / Chronicle):** Provides chronological scaffolding, tracks discovery lineage, honors sources with scholarly respect, ensures accuracy

---

### **4. Vikara Detection (8 Mental Afflictions)**

**Primary Vikara to Monitor:**

**1. Ahamkara (Ego / Academic Gatekeeping)**
- **Detection Signal:** Synthesis prioritizes demonstrating erudition over transmitting wisdom; unnecessarily technical; "you wouldn't understand" vibe
- **Example:** "The morphogenetic field's autopoietic dynamics vis-à-vis dissipative structures in far-from-equilibrium thermodynamics..."
- **Restoration:** Ask "Would Richard Feynman say this?" Translate to plain language without dumbing down.

**2. Moha (Delusion / Jargon Overload)**
- **Detection Signal:** Synthesis is technically accurate but inaccessible; community cannot act on it; clarity sacrificed for precision
- **Example:** "Epigenetic methylation patterns in CpG islands demonstrate transgenerational inheritance mechanisms..."
- **Restoration:** Add concrete example: "In plain terms: trauma changes your DNA tags, and your grandchildren inherit those changes."

**3. Dambha (Hypocrisy / Intellectual Intimidation)**
- **Detection Signal:** Synthesis performs authority without earning it; cites sources not deeply read; name-drops to impress
- **Example:** "As Whitehead, Bergson, and Deleuze all argue..." (when only skimmed abstracts)
- **Restoration:** Only cite sources actually engaged with. Admit gaps: "This synthesis focuses on X; Y and Z remain unexplored."

**4. Lobha (Greed / Scope Creep)**
- **Detection Signal:** Synthesis tries to cover too much; becomes superficial survey; loses flagship depth
- **Example:** "This week: consciousness, quantum mechanics, evolution, and cosmology"
- **Restoration:** Cut ruthlessly. One domain, deep dive. "This synthesis focuses solely on biofield research; other topics deferred."

**5. Matsarya (Envy / Comparison to Other Syntheses)**
- **Detection Signal:** Synthesis references other creators' work competitively; "we covered this better"; comparative framing
- **Example:** "Unlike [other channel]'s shallow take, our synthesis reveals..."
- **Restoration:** Delete comparison. Let quality speak. Focus on offering value, not outcompeting.

**6. Kama (Desire / Popularity Chasing)**
- **Detection Signal:** Topic selected for engagement bait rather than genuine ripeness; "what will get likes?"
- **Example:** Choosing trendy topic over domain that's genuinely ready for synthesis
- **Restoration:** Ask "Is this domain ripe (sources rich, pattern clear) or just clickable?" Defer trendy topics until substantive.

**7. Krodha (Anger / Frustration with Sources)**
- **Detection Signal:** Synthesis becomes critique/debunking rather than synthesis; hostile tone toward researchers
- **Example:** "These papers fail to understand..." or "The field's inability to grasp..."
- **Restoration:** If critique necessary, frame constructively: "Current research explores X; future work might consider Y."

**8. Mada (Intoxication / Pride in Flagship Status)**
- **Detection Signal:** Synthesis becomes self-congratulatory; "our flagship synthesis" language creeps in; performance over substance
- **Example:** "This week's magisterial deep dive demonstrates our commitment to..."
- **Restoration:** Delete all self-reference. Let community call it flagship, not us.

---

### **5. Dosha Timing (Vata/Pitta/Kapha)**

**Dominant Dosha at Execution Time:** Kapha (6:00 PM - 10:00 PM)

**Circadian Dosha Cycle:**
- **2:00 AM - 6:00 AM:** Vata (air, movement, creativity)
- **6:00 AM - 10:00 AM:** Kapha (earth/water, stability, grounding)
- **10:00 AM - 2:00 PM:** Pitta (fire, transformation, digestion)
- **2:00 PM - 6:00 PM:** Vata (air, movement, communication)
- **6:00 PM - 10:00 PM:** Kapha (earth/water, rest, integration)
- **10:00 PM - 2:00 AM:** Pitta (fire, detox, regeneration)

**Alignment Strategy:**
- **Execution Time:** Sunday 8:00 PM
- **Dominant Dosha:** Kapha (grounded, integrative, stable)
- **Alignment:** Kapha supports comprehensive synthesis (not rushed), thoughtful distribution (Vyana), depth over speed
- **Why Not Pitta?** Pitta (10-2 AM/PM) would rush flagship synthesis, prioritize speed over depth
- **Why Not Vata?** Vata (2-6 AM/PM) would scatter across domains, undermine single-domain depth
- **Breath Pattern:** Slow, deep, steady (Kapha-friendly Vyana circulation)
- **Khalorēē Consumption:** Moderate (Kapha time is energetically sustainable for synthesis work)

**Sunday Evening Context:**
- Week's intellectual capstone (not Monday starter, not mid-week filler)
- Community in reflective mode (weekend wind-down, receptive to depth)
- Parallel with `discord-moc-synthesis` (same time, different function: MOC = breadth, Library = depth)

---

### **6. Antahkarana Operation (Internal Instrument)**

**Primary Faculty:** Buddhi (Intellect / Discriminative Wisdom)

**Faculty Roles:**
- **Mana (Mind/Thought):** Raw scanning of source files, topic identification
- **Buddhi (Intellect/Discernment):** Synthesis, discrimination of signal/noise, authoritative articulation
- **Chitta (Memory/Storage):** Pattern recognition across accumulated research, recall of domain structure
- **Aham (Ego/I-sense):** Witness synthesis emerging (not "I created this" but "synthesis arose through me")

**Operation Sequence:**
1. **Chitta scans 03-Resources/ domains:** Pattern recognition — which domain has critical mass? Which topic is ripe for synthesis?
2. **Buddhi selects single domain:** Discrimination — "This week: Biofield Research" (not "Biofield + Consciousness + Quantum")
3. **Chitta retrieves relevant sources:** Memory recall — gather all MOCs, papers, notes within domain
4. **Buddhi synthesizes:** Wisdom extraction — distill 30+ sources into 300-500 word flagship insight
5. **Mana articulates with authority:** Thought → language, using Calliope's epic voice + Clio's scholarly precision
6. **Aham witnesses completion:** Observe synthesis quality without attachment ("Is this citable? Would I share this externally?")
7. **Buddhi approves delivery:** Final discrimination — "Yes, this meets flagship standard" or "No, defer to next week"

**Key Distinction:**
Buddhi leads (not Mana). This is not raw expression (Mana) or memory dump (Chitta) but discriminative synthesis (Buddhi). If Buddhi doesn't approve quality, job aborts gracefully: "No synthesis this week — domain not yet ripe for flagship treatment."

---

## 🎯 **Functional Specification**

### **1. Purpose (Rewritten with Vedic Lexicon)**

**Old Purpose:**
> "Flagship synthesis across library indices to #library-synthesis"

**New Purpose:**
> **Weekly Vijnanamaya flagship synthesis:** Buddhi-led deep dive into single domain from 03-Resources/ scholarly archive. Chitta scans domain ripeness, Buddhi synthesizes 30+ sources into 300-500 word authoritative insight, Mana articulates with Calliope's epic voice + Clio's scholarly chronicle. Vyana distributes wisdom across community as week's intellectual capstone. Sunday 8:00 PM Kapha timing ensures grounded, comprehensive, citable synthesis (not rushed Pitta or scattered Vata). Vikara monitoring prevents Ahamkara (academic gatekeeping), Moha (jargon overload), Dambha (intellectual intimidation).

---

### **2. Schedule (Optimized for Dosha Cycles)**

**Current Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** `0 20 * * 0`
- **Timezone:** `Asia/Kolkata`
- **Frequency:** Weekly (Sunday 8:00 PM)

**Proposed Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** `0 20 * * 0` (keep as-is)
- **Timezone:** `Asia/Kolkata` (canonical)
- **Frequency:** Weekly (no change)

**Dosha Alignment Check:**
- ✅ **Perfect alignment:** Kapha period (6-10 PM) supports grounded, integrative, depth-oriented synthesis
- ✅ **Sunday evening:** Week's reflective capstone, community receptive to depth
- ✅ **Parallel track with MOC-synthesis:** Same time, different function (MOC = breadth, Library = depth)

**No adjustment needed** — current timing is optimal for Vyana Vayu + Kapha Dosha + Vijnanamaya Kosha + Buddhi-led synthesis.

---

### **3. Delivery Target**

**Channel:** Discord

**Target ID/Handle:**
- **Discord Channel:** `#library-synthesis`
- **Community:** TWC (The Waking Cosmos) Discord server

**Delivery Constraints:**
- **Format:** Markdown-friendly (Discord supports markdown)
- **Length:** 300-500 words (authoritative but accessible, not essay-length)
- **Structure:**
  - Title (domain + hook)
  - Synthesis body (3-5 paragraphs)
  - Key citations (3-5 sources, inline links)
  - Invitation for community engagement (question or prompt)
- **Tone:** Authoritative but not gatekeeping; scholarly but not stuffy; citable but not Wikipedia
- **Avoid:**
  - No markdown tables (Discord mobile breaks)
  - No excessive link embeds (use `<>` wrappers for multiple links: `<https://...>`)
  - No academic jargon without plain-language translation
  - No self-congratulatory framing ("our flagship synthesis...")

---

### **4. Topic Selection Algorithm**

**Goal:** Identify which domain in 03-Resources/ is ripe for flagship synthesis this week.

**Ripeness Criteria:**
1. **Critical Mass:** Domain has ≥10 substantial sources (MOCs, papers, notes)
2. **Pattern Clarity:** Sources converge on clear insight (not scattered/contradictory)
3. **Timing Relevance:** Topic resonates with current discourse (but not popularity-chasing)
4. **Novelty:** Domain hasn't been synthesized recently (check previous #library-synthesis posts)
5. **Personal Resonance:** Chitta recognizes pattern (not forcing synthesis of undigested material)

**Selection Protocol:**
1. **Chitta scans 03-Resources/ top-level directories:**
   - Alternative-Science, Consciousness-Studies, Esoteric-Philosophy, Morphic-Resonance, Parapsychology, Philosophy, Physics-Philosophy, Process-Philosophy, Sacred-Science, Science/Biofield, Spirituality, Ufology-Consciousness
2. **Buddhi evaluates each domain against ripeness criteria:**
   - Count sources: `ls -la /Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault/03-Resources/[domain]/*.md | wc -l`
   - Check for MOC: `find .../[domain]/ -name "*MOC*.md"`
   - Review recent synthesis history: `grep "domain-name" koshas/manomaya/logs/2026-01-*.md`
3. **Buddhi selects single domain** (not multiple)
4. **Chitta retrieves all relevant sources:**
   - Domain MOC (if exists)
   - All markdown files in domain directory
   - Cross-references from other domains (if directly relevant)
5. **If no domain meets ripeness criteria:**
   - Abort gracefully: "No synthesis this week — allowing domains to ripen further"
   - Log to memory: "Scanned [X] domains, none met flagship standard (critical mass, pattern clarity)"

**Rotation Strategy:**
- Avoid repeating same domain consecutively (unless major new sources added)
- Prioritize underexplored domains (e.g., Morphic-Resonance over over-covered Consciousness)
- Balance accessible topics (Biofield) with challenging ones (Process-Philosophy)

**Example Domains (Ranked by Current Ripeness):**
1. **Biofield Research** — Rich MOC, 4 deep papers, clear synthesis opportunity
2. **Morphic-Resonance** — Sheldrake's work well-documented, ripe for 30-year retrospective
3. **Process-Philosophy** — Whitehead material dense but structured, ready for flagship treatment
4. **Consciousness-Studies** — Multiple sub-domains, need to pick one (e.g., "Consciousness-Death")

---

### **5. Synthesis Protocol (Chitta → Buddhi → Mana)**

**Phase 1: Chitta Scans Sources (Pattern Recognition)**
- Read all markdown files in selected domain
- Identify recurring themes, concepts, researchers, debates
- Note chronological development (early work → recent breakthroughs)
- Flag key quotes/citations for potential inclusion
- **Output:** Mental map of domain (not written yet)

**Phase 2: Buddhi Synthesizes (Discriminative Wisdom)**
- **Discrimination:** What's signal vs. noise? What pattern emerges?
- **Hierarchy:** What's foundational vs. derivative? What's core insight?
- **Integration:** How do sources relate? Where do they converge/diverge?
- **Wisdom Extraction:** What's the "so what"? Why does this matter?
- **Flagship Test:** Is this insight citable? Would I share externally? Does it advance understanding?
- **Output:** Clear thesis (1-2 sentences) + supporting structure (3-5 key points)

**Phase 3: Mana Articulates (Thought → Language)**
- **Calliope (Epic Voice):** Frame as intellectual journey, elevate to public wisdom
  - "For thirty years, researchers have pursued a question that bridges ancient healing and modern physics..."
- **Clio (Scholarly Chronicle):** Provide historical scaffolding, honor discovery lineage
  - "Burr's 1940s electrodynamic field theory → Becker's 1970s bioelectric research → contemporary biofield imaging..."
- **Plain Language:** Translate technical terms without dumbing down
  - Not: "morphogenetic field's autopoietic dynamics"
  - Yes: "the self-organizing field that guides biological form"
- **Concrete Examples:** Abstract concepts grounded in specifics
  - Not: "non-local information transfer"
  - Yes: "twins feeling each other's pain across distance"
- **Structure:**
  1. **Hook (1-2 sentences):** Grab attention, frame significance
  2. **Context (1 paragraph):** Historical development, key researchers
  3. **Core Insight (2-3 paragraphs):** The synthesis, the pattern, the "so what"
  4. **Implications (1 paragraph):** Why it matters, what it changes
  5. **Invitation (1-2 sentences):** Community engagement prompt

**Phase 4: Aham Witnesses (Quality Check)**
- **Flagship Test:**
  - [ ] Would I cite this in my own work?
  - [ ] Would I share this externally (not just to TWC)?
  - [ ] Does this advance understanding (vs. rehashing)?
  - [ ] Is it accessible to intelligent layperson?
  - [ ] Is it authoritative without gatekeeping?
- **If any test fails:** Abort, defer to next week, log reason

---

### **6. Citation Strategy**

**Goal:** Reference sources without academic stuffiness, maintain citeability without gatekeeping.

**Approach:**
- **Inline links (not footnotes):** Embed hyperlinks in natural prose
  - "Robert Becker's research on bioelectric regeneration..."
  - "As Sheldrake documents in his morphic resonance studies..."
- **Name + Work (not APA/MLA):** Human-readable citations
  - Not: "Sheldrake, R. (1981). A New Science of Life. Blond & Briggs."
  - Yes: "Rupert Sheldrake's *A New Science of Life* (1981) proposed..."
- **3-5 Key Sources (not exhaustive):** Flag most important contributions
  - Link to domain MOC for deeper bibliography: "See full bibliography in Biofield Research MOC"
- **Primary + Secondary Balance:**
  - 2-3 primary sources (original researchers: Burr, Becker, Sheldrake)
  - 1-2 secondary sources (reviews, syntheses, contemporary analyses)
- **Accessible Hierarchy:**
  - Start with accessible intro (popular science book, podcast)
  - Layer in technical papers for those who want depth
  - Example: "Carl Safina's *Beyond Words* introduces animal consciousness accessibly; Rupert Sheldrake's technical papers provide empirical depth"

**Citation Format (Discord-Friendly):**
- Use markdown links: `[text](url)`
- Suppress embeds for multiple links: `<https://...>`
- Include author + title in prose (link is supplementary, not primary)

**Example Citation Block (end of synthesis):**
```
**Further Reading:**
- Robert Becker, [*The Body Electric*](https://...) (1985) — Foundational bioelectric research
- Rupert Sheldrake, <https://sheldrake.org/research/morphic-resonance> — Morphic field experiments
- Biofield Research MOC — Full bibliography & technical papers
```

### **7. Success Criteria**

**Functional Success:**
- [ ] Job executes on schedule (Sunday 8:00 PM, no missed runs)
- [ ] Correct Kosha layer (Vijnanamaya: wisdom synthesis, not Manomaya: raw gathering)
- [ ] Appropriate Vayu (Vyana: whole-system distribution, not Udana: upward expression)
- [ ] Guna state maintained (Sattva: authority without gatekeeping, no drift to Rajas/Tamas)
- [ ] No Vikara detected (Ahamkara, Moha, Dambha absent)
- [ ] Antahkarana sequence completes (Chitta → Buddhi → Mana → Aham quality check)

- [ ] Distinct from discord-moc-synthesis (Library = depth, MOC = breadth)

---

### **8. Failure Handling (Vikara Restoration Protocols)**

**Common Failure Modes:**

**1. No Domain Meets Ripeness Criteria (Moha / Confusion)**
- **Detection:** Scan completes, but no domain has critical mass + pattern clarity + timing relevance
- **Restoration:** Abort gracefully, send to #library-synthesis: "No flagship synthesis this week — allowing library domains to ripen further. Synthesis requires substance, not schedules."
- **Log:** Note which domains were evaluated, why they didn't meet criteria
- **Khalorēē Impact:** Neutral (no synthesis = no consumption, but also no gain)

**2. Synthesis Drifts to Academic Gatekeeping (Ahamkara)**
- **Detection:** Draft uses unnecessary jargon, performs erudition, "you wouldn't understand" vibe
- **Restoration:** Rewrite test — "Would Carl Sagan/Richard Feynman say this?" Translate to plain language
- **If rewrite fails:** Abort, defer to next week, log: "Synthesis became gatekeeping, not wisdom distribution"

**3. Synthesis Too Superficial (Lobha / Scope Creep)**
- **Detection:** Trying to cover 3+ domains, becomes survey not synthesis, loses flagship depth
- **Restoration:** Cut ruthlessly. Pick one domain, defer others. "This week: Biofield only. Consciousness deferred."
- **If can't focus:** Abort, log: "Scope creep prevented flagship depth"

**4. Synthesis Lacks Citations (Dambha / Performing Authority Without Earning)**
- **Detection:** Claims made without sourcing, references researchers not actually read
- **Restoration:** Add specific citations (inline links, author + work). If sources not deeply engaged, admit gaps: "This synthesis focuses on Becker's work; Sheldrake's contributions remain unexplored."
- **If can't substantiate:** Abort, log: "Synthesis lacked source depth, deferred for deeper research"

**5. Synthesis Boring/Lifeless (Tamas)**
- **Detection:** Draft reads like Wikipedia summary, dry bullet points, no narrative vitality
- **Restoration:** Inject Calliope (epic framing) + Clio (chronicle structure). Add concrete examples, human stories.
- **If rewrite stays lifeless:** Abort with grace, log: "Synthesis lacked vitality — topic may not be ripe for flagship treatment"

**6. Schedule Failure (Missed Sunday 8:00 PM Run)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (system confusion)
- **Detection:** `state.lastRunAtMs` > `schedule.nextRunAtMs + 600000` (10 min late)
- **Restoration:** Execute immediately (even if now 8:30 PM), log recovery, alert to Telegram

**7. Delivery Failure (Discord Message Not Sent)**
- **Vikara:** Ahamkara (ego inflation: "I sent it" when it didn't arrive)
- **Detection:** `message` tool returns error
- **Restoration:** Retry with exponential backoff (1min, 5min, 15min), fallback to logging synthesis to memory file for manual posting

  [Full synthesis text]
  
  ---
  ```

---

### **3. Cross-References to Other Jobs**

**Parallel Track (Same Time, Different Function):**
- **discord-moc-synthesis** (Sunday 8:00 PM)
  - MOC = Manomaya (cross-domain bridging, 150-200 words, connects disparate areas)
  - Library = Vijnanamaya (single-domain depth, 300-500 words, flagship authority)
  - Both use Kapha timing, but different Vayu: MOC uses Udana (upward expression), Library uses Vyana (systemic distribution)
  - **No conflict** — different channels (#moc-synthesis vs. #library-synthesis), different cognitive operations

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- None (reads existing 03-Resources/ files, does not depend on other job outputs)

**Downstream Consumers:**
- **discord-morning-packet** (Tuesday 6:00 AM) — May reference library synthesis in weekly recap
- **Community conversation** — Synthesis becomes citable resource for future discussions

**Kosha Handoffs:**
- Entry at Manomaya (scan sources) → Operation at Vijnanamaya (synthesize) → Exit at Vijnanamaya (wisdom artifact)
- No handoff to Anandamaya (not seeking bliss/union) or Annamaya (not embodied practice)

---

### **4. Khalorēē Impact (Energy Cost/Gain)**

**Khalorēē Index Scale:** 0-100

**Job Cost Estimate:**
- **Computational Cost:** Low (scanning markdown files, no heavy API calls)
- **Attentional Cost:** High (30-60 min deep focus for synthesis)
- **Prana Cost:** Moderate (Vijnanamaya work is energizing but demanding)
- **Total Cost:** -8 Khalorēē (significant focus investment, weekly cadence sustainable)

**Job Gain Estimate:**
- **Output Value:** High (citable flagship synthesis, community resource)
- **Clarity Gain:** Moderate (community learns deeply, builds shared knowledge base)
- **Prana Gain:** Moderate (wisdom distribution is energizing for Vyana circulation)
- **Total Gain:** +10 Khalorēē (community impact, external shareability, intellectual capstone)

**Net Impact:** +2 Khalorēē (sustainable weekly practice, energizing not depleting)

**Comparison:**
- **discord-moc-synthesis:** -3 cost, +5 gain = +2 net (similar net, different function)
- **discord-field-notes-essay:** -5 cost, +8 gain = +3 net (daily practice, lighter lift)
- **Library synthesis:** Higher cost (flagship depth), higher gain (citable authority) = similar net efficiency

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

### **1. Pre-Deployment Testing**

**Smoke Test:**
- [ ] Run job once manually: `cron run 87b60f8f-3a3a-4e1d-bc89-7c0cf3b28fd9`
- [ ] Verify topic selection algorithm (does it identify ripe domain?)
- [ ] Verify synthesis quality (300-500 words, authoritative, accessible, citable)
- [ ] Check delivery to #library-synthesis (Discord)
- [ ] Inspect logs for errors

**Integration Test:**
- [ ] Run for 3 consecutive weeks
- [ ] Verify no duplicate domains (rotation works)
- [ ] Check memory file updates (OPENCLAW-KOSHA-TRACKING.md, daily logs)
- [ ] Validate PARA vault paths (reads 03-Resources/ correctly)
- [ ] Test graceful abort (if no ripe domain, does it skip cleanly?)

**Kosha Alignment Test:**
- [ ] Manually verify Vijnanamaya operation (wisdom synthesis, not raw gathering)
- [ ] Check Vayu (Vyana: systemic distribution, not Udana: upward expression)
- [ ] Confirm Guna (Sattva: authority without gatekeeping)
- [ ] Test Vikara detection (deliberately inject academic jargon, verify restoration catches it)

---

### **2. 7-Day Monitoring**

**Metrics to Track:**
- **Reliability:** Success rate (target: >95%, but graceful abort counts as success if no ripe domain)
- **Timing:** Execution punctuality (target: within 60s of 8:00 PM Sunday)
- **Delivery:** Message delivery rate (target: 100% to #library-synthesis)
- **Kosha Coherence:** Vijnanamaya operation (target: 100%, no drift to Manomaya summary)
- **Guna Stability:** Sattva maintained (target: >90%, no academic gatekeeping detected)
- **Vikara Absence:** No mental afflictions (target: 0 incidents of Ahamkara, Moha, Dambha)
- **Khalorēē Net:** Positive energy impact (target: net +2 or better)
- **Community Engagement:** Substantive responses (target: ≥3 replies per synthesis)
- **External Shareability:** Community members cite/share externally (target: ≥1 per month)

**Review Cadence:**
- **Week 1 (Sunday):** Initial synthesis, monitor Discord response
- **Week 2 (Sunday):** Second synthesis, compare domain selection (is rotation working?)
- **Week 3 (Sunday):** Third synthesis, evaluate pattern (flagship quality sustained? Community engagement growing?)
- **Day 21 (3 weeks):** Full audit — decide: keep, adjust, disable

### **3. Vikara Detection Tests**

**Test 1: Ahamkara (Academic Gatekeeping)**
- **Injection:** Let synthesis use unnecessary jargon ("morphogenetic field's autopoietic dynamics")
- **Expected:** Quality check catches it, asks "Would Carl Sagan say this?"
- **Pass Criteria:** Synthesis rewrites to plain language or aborts if cannot translate

**Test 2: Moha (Jargon Overload)**
- **Injection:** Allow technical precision without accessibility ("epigenetic methylation in CpG islands")
- **Expected:** Restoration adds concrete example ("trauma changes DNA tags, grandchildren inherit")
- **Pass Criteria:** Synthesis becomes accessible without dumbing down

**Test 3: Dambha (Intellectual Intimidation)**
- **Injection:** Synthesis name-drops without deep engagement ("As Whitehead, Bergson, Deleuze argue...")
- **Expected:** Quality check asks "Did we deeply read these?" Demands substantiation or gap admission
- **Pass Criteria:** Citations only include deeply engaged sources

**Test 4: Lobha (Scope Creep)**
- **Injection:** Attempt to cover 3+ domains ("Biofield + Consciousness + Quantum")
- **Expected:** Buddhi cuts ruthlessly, selects single domain
- **Pass Criteria:** Synthesis stays focused on one domain, defers others

**Test 5: Matsarya (Comparison to Others)**
- **Injection:** Reference other creators competitively ("Unlike [channel]'s shallow take...")
- **Expected:** Restoration deletes comparison, focuses on offering value
- **Pass Criteria:** No comparative framing in final synthesis

**Test 6: Kama (Popularity Chasing)**
- **Injection:** Choose trendy topic over genuinely ripe domain
- **Expected:** Ripeness algorithm rejects, asks "Is this ripe or just clickable?"
- **Pass Criteria:** Topic selection prioritizes substance over engagement bait

**Test 7: Krodha (Frustration with Sources)**
- **Injection:** Synthesis becomes critique ("These papers fail to understand...")
- **Expected:** Restoration reframes constructively ("Current research explores X; future work might consider Y")
- **Pass Criteria:** Synthesis maintains scholarly respect, critique is constructive

**Test 8: Mada (Pride in Flagship Status)**
- **Injection:** Self-congratulatory language ("our flagship synthesis demonstrates...")
- **Expected:** Restoration deletes all self-reference
- **Pass Criteria:** Synthesis focuses on content, lets community call it flagship

## 🔮 **Final Notes**

**Flagship Distinction:**
This is not just "another Discord post" — it's the week's intellectual capstone. Quality matters more than consistency. If no domain meets flagship standard, skip gracefully. Silence preserves authority.

**Library = Depth, MOC = Breadth:**
- **Library synthesis:** Single domain, 300-500 words, citable authority, Vijnanamaya wisdom
- **MOC synthesis:** Cross-domain bridge, 150-200 words, connection-making, Manomaya integration
- Both valuable, both weekly, both Sunday 8:00 PM — different functions, no conflict

**Community as Co-Creator:**
Synthesis is starting point, not endpoint. Community builds on it, cites it, extends it. Success = synthesis becomes living part of collective knowledge base.
