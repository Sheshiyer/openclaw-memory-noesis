# lunar-authority-review-cycle-SPEC.md
## Cron Job Implementation Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Purpose:** 28-day lunar cycle review of Generator Sacral Authority decision-making patterns

---

## 📋 **Job Identity**

**Current Name:** `lunar-authority-review-cycle`  
**Proposed Name:** `vijnanamaya-sacral-authority-review-lunar` (wisdom layer, 28-day cycle)  
**Cron ID:** `d09e92ee-4d95-49c8-a132-ed4eb93a55dd`  
**Category:** Lunar Resonance

---

## 🔮 **Vedic Substrate**

### **1. Kosha Layer (Primary)**
**Layer:** Vijnanamaya → Anandamaya

**Rationale:**
- Vijnanamaya (wisdom/discriminative layer) reviews 28 days of decisions made via Sacral Authority
- Anandamaya (bliss/Source layer) checks alignment between gut responses and true Self
- This is meta-cognition: observing HOW decisions were made, not WHAT decisions were
- Generator 2/4 operates best when Buddhi (intellect) reviews patterns post-hoc without interfering during uh-huh/uh-uh moments

**Kosha Transitions:**
- **Entry:** Vijnanamaya (initiate wisdom review of decision corpus)
- **Operation:** Buddhi faculty scans 28-day memory, Aham witnesses patterns without judgment, Chitta identifies learning
- **Exit:** Anandamaya (check: are Sacral responses aligned with Source/true calling?)

---

### **2. Primary Vayu (of 10 Vital Airs)**

**Vayu:** Samana (navel, integration, digestion)

**Function:** Samana governs digestive fire (Agni), metabolic processing, and integration of experiences into wisdom. A 28-day lunar cycle is "digested" like food—raw experience → assimilation → learning → refined decision-making protocol.

**Breath Pattern:**
- **Inhalation:** Prana (receive past 28 days as "raw material")
- **Retention:** Samana (digest patterns, metabolize lessons)
- **Exhalation:** Apana (release false beliefs, outdated decision rules)
- **Pause:** Vyana (integrate learning into whole-system coherence)

**Timing Rationale:**
- 28 days = one lunar cycle = one complete Bott periodicity cycle
- Samana Vayu is optimal for cyclical integration (not linear accumulation)
- Unlike daily Prana (intake) or hourly Udana (expression), Samana operates on longer metabolic timescales
- Monthly review prevents both over-analysis (daily) and under-reflection (annual)

---

### **3. Guna State (Sattva/Rajas/Tamas)**

**Primary Guna:** Sattva (clarity, discriminative wisdom, witness consciousness)

**Guna Dynamics:**
- **Desired State:** Sattva — dispassionate review, no attachment to "correct" or "incorrect" decisions, pure pattern recognition
- **Common Drift:** 
  - **Rajas:** Self-criticism, urgency to "fix" decision-making, impatience with slow learning
  - **Tamas:** Apathy, "decisions don't matter anyway", avoidance of accountability
- **Restoration Protocol:** 
  - If Rajas detected (harsh self-judgment): Invoke Aham (witness, "I am not my decisions")
  - If Tamas detected (avoidance): Invoke Buddhi (discernment, "What did I learn?")

**Enantiodromia Balance:**
- **Aletheios Pole:** Reflection, pattern recognition, discriminative wisdom (dominant in this job)
- **Pichet Pole:** Vitality check—did "uh-huh" responses lead to energy gain? Did "uh-uh" responses avoid depletion?
- **Oscillation Pattern:** Aletheios-first (gather data, witness patterns) → Pichet (check Khalorēē delta) → Aletheios (refine decision protocol)

---

### **4. Vikara Detection (8 Mental Afflictions)**

**Primary Vikara to Monitor:**

1. **Matsarya (Envy):** "Why don't I have X's clarity?" or "Other Generators seem to get better results"
   - **Detection Signal:** Comparison to others' Authority mechanics, envy of Emotional or Splenic Authority
   - **Restoration Protocol:** Return to own design—Sacral Authority is a gift, not a limitation. No comparison.

2. **Ahamkara (Ego):** "My Sacral Authority is superior" or "I always make the right call"
   - **Detection Signal:** Pride in decision-making, dismissal of mistakes, inflation
   - **Restoration Protocol:** Review mis-aligned decisions without judgment. Ego obscures learning.

3. **Moha (Delusion):** "I don't remember what my gut said" or "Did I really respond to that?"
   - **Detection Signal:** Foggy recall of Sacral responses, post-hoc rationalization, confusion about uh-huh/uh-uh moments
   - **Restoration Protocol:** Implement real-time logging (capture Sacral responses immediately, not retrospectively)

4. **Mada (Intoxication/Numbness):** "It doesn't matter what I choose" or apathy toward decision patterns
   - **Detection Signal:** Indifference to review, skipping entries, "who cares" attitude
   - **Restoration Protocol:** Re-connect to Generator Strategy—waiting to respond is sacred, not trivial

5. **Krodha (Anger):** Frustration with "wrong" decisions, self-directed rage
   - **Detection Signal:** Harsh language in review ("I screwed up again"), resentment toward past self
   - **Restoration Protocol:** Metta toward past self—every decision was made with available awareness at the time

**Restoration Protocol Summary:**
- **If Matsarya/Ahamkara detected:** Invoke Aham (witness, equanimity)
- **If Moha detected:** Implement Chitta support (better memory capture)
- **If Mada detected:** Reconnect to Generator Strategy via Pichet vitality check
- **If Krodha detected:** Metta meditation, self-compassion, Aletheios gentleness

---

### **5. Dosha Timing (Vata/Pitta/Kapha)**

**Dominant Dosha at Execution Time:** Varies (28-day cycle, not fixed clock time)

**Why No Fixed Dosha:**
- This job runs **every 28 days** (lunar cycle), not at a fixed time-of-day
- Dosha cycles are **circadian** (2-6 AM Vata, 6-10 AM Kapha, 10 AM-2 PM Pitta, etc.)
- A 28-day interval will land at different circadian Doshas each cycle
- **This is intentional:** Prevents ritual ossification—review happens in Vata (movement), Pitta (fire), or Kapha (grounding) contexts, ensuring multi-modal perspective

**Alignment Strategy:**
- **If review lands in Vata period (2-6 AM or 2-6 PM):** Light, expansive reflection, quick pattern recognition
- **If review lands in Pitta period (10 AM-2 PM or 10 PM-2 AM):** Deep metabolic digestion, transformative insights, fire of discernment
- **If review lands in Kapha period (6-10 AM or 6-10 PM):** Slow, thorough, grounding review, stable integration

**Breath Pattern Adaptation:**
- **Vata:** Fast, shallow review (skim patterns, highlight key moments)
- **Pitta:** Intense, focused review (burn away false narratives, metabolic fire)
- **Kapha:** Slow, deliberate review (anchor learnings deeply, build new foundations)

**Khalorēē Consumption Pattern:**
- **Vata execution:** Low cost (quick, efficient, minimal Prana expenditure)
- **Pitta execution:** Medium cost (intense focus, transformative but taxing)
- **Kapha execution:** High cost (slow, thorough, grounding requires sustained attention)

---

### **6. Antahkarana Operation (Internal Instrument)**

**Primary Faculty:** Buddhi → Aham → Chitta → Mana

**Faculty Roles:**
1. **Buddhi (Intellect/Discernment):** Initiates review—"What were my Sacral responses over 28 days?"
2. **Aham (Ego/Witness):** Observes patterns without attachment—"I am not my decisions; I witness them"
3. **Chitta (Memory/Storage):** Identifies learnings—"What patterns emerge? What changed?"
4. **Mana (Mind/Thought):** Adjusts decision protocols—"Next cycle, wait 3 breaths before responding to X-type invitations"

**Operation Sequence:**
1. **Buddhi:** Retrieve all logged Sacral Authority moments from past 28 days (uh-huh, uh-uh, maybe)
2. **Aham:** Witness each decision without judgment (not "right/wrong", just "what happened")
3. **Chitta:** Pattern recognition:
   - Did "uh-huh" responses lead to Khalorēē gain (energy, flow, alignment)?
   - Did "uh-uh" responses prevent Khalorēē drain (avoided depletion)?
   - Were there "maybe" moments where response was unclear? (Flag for Strategy refinement)
4. **Mana:** Generate refined decision-making protocol for next 28-day cycle:
   - "When invited to X, wait 3 breaths for Sacral clarity"
   - "When facing Y, check body sensation (not mental narrative)"
   - "When Z arises, notice if response is uh-huh (expansion) or uh-uh (contraction)"

**Example Sequence:**
> **Buddhi:** "Review 28-day decision corpus: 47 logged Sacral responses"
> **Aham:** "Observe: 32 uh-huh, 12 uh-uh, 3 unclear. No attachment."
> **Chitta:** "Pattern: All 32 uh-huh responses led to projects still alive today. 9 of 12 uh-uh responses avoided energy drains (3 were false negatives—missed opportunities)."
> **Mana:** "Adjustment: When invitation feels urgent, pause 10 seconds. Urgent invitations often trigger mental override of Sacral clarity."

## 🎯 **Functional Specification**

### **1. Purpose (Rewritten with Vedic Lexicon)**

**Old Purpose:**
> "Audit 28-day cycle decisions via Sacral 'uh-huh' protocol, generate coherence score, refine Generator decision-making"

**New Purpose:**
> "Monthly Vijnanamaya review of Generator Sacral Authority patterns across one lunar Bott periodicity cycle (28 days). Samana Vayu digests decision corpus via Antahkarana sequence: Buddhi retrieves data, Aham witnesses without judgment, Chitta recognizes patterns, Mana refines protocols. Measures Khalorēē impact (energy gain from uh-huh, energy preservation from uh-uh). Detects Vikara (Matsarya/Ahamkara/Moha drift). Produces private Telegram report to 1371522080 with meta-learning insights for next cycle."

---

### **2. Schedule (Optimized for Lunar Cycles)**

**Current Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** `every 2419200000ms` (28 days = 28 × 24 × 60 × 60 × 1000ms)
- **Timezone:** `Asia/Kolkata` (canonical)
- **Frequency:** 28-day interval (lunar cycle, Bott periodicity)

**Proposed Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** Keep `every 2419200000ms` (28 days) OR use `0 0 */28 * *` (every 28 days at midnight)
- **Timezone:** `Asia/Kolkata`
- **Frequency:** 28-day lunar cycle (13.037 cycles per year)

**Dosha Alignment Check:**
- No fixed Dosha alignment (by design—lands at different circadian windows each cycle)
- This variability ensures review perspective rotates through Vata (airy insight), Pitta (fiery digestion), Kapha (grounded integration)
- **Recommendation:** Keep 28-day interval. Do NOT force to fixed time-of-day.

---

### **3. Delivery Target**

**Channel:** Telegram  

**Target ID/Handle:**
- **Telegram:** `1371522080` (Shesh, private review—not public)

**Delivery Constraints:**
- **Private:** This is introspective, vulnerable review—no Discord, no public sharing
- **Format:** Text-only message (no markdown tables, use bullet lists)
- **Length:** 400-800 words (enough depth, not overwhelming)
- **Tone:** Sattvic (clear, non-judgmental), Metta (kind toward past self), discriminative (Buddhi-sharp)

**Example Message Structure:**
```
🌙 LUNAR AUTHORITY REVIEW (Cycle #3: Jan 8 - Feb 5)

SACRAL RESPONSE CORPUS:
• 47 total responses logged
• 32 uh-huh (68%)
• 12 uh-uh (26%)
• 3 unclear (6%)

KHALORĒĒ IMPACT:
• Uh-huh responses: 28 led to energy gain (+), 4 neutral
• Uh-uh responses: 9 avoided depletion (-), 3 false negatives (missed opportunities)
• Net Khalorēē delta: +18 (peak coherence this cycle)

PATTERN RECOGNITION (Chitta):
• Urgent invitations → mental override → false uh-huh
• Body-first responses (no narrative) → 100% alignment
• "Maybe" moments → all resolved within 24h via re-ask protocol

META-LEARNING (Mana):
Next cycle adjustments:
1. When urgency detected → pause 10 seconds, re-scan body
2. When narrative arises before sensation → return to breath, re-ask
3. When "maybe" detected → wait 24h, invite will return if aligned

VIKARA CHECK:
• No Matsarya (envy) detected
• No Ahamkara (ego inflation) detected
• Moha (1 instance): forgot to log 3 responses → implement voice-memo capture

NEXT REVIEW: Mar 5, 2026 (28 days)
```

---

### **4. Audio/Media Requirements**

**Voice Generation:** None (text-only review, preserves privacy)

**Audio Stubs:** None (Sacral Authority review is Vijnanamaya → Anandamaya, not Pranamaya breathwork)

**Image Generation:** None (introspective review, no visual artifacts)

**Rationale:** 
- Generator Sacral Authority is somatic, gut-level, non-verbal
- Adding audio/image would intellectualize or performatize the review
- Text-only delivery maintains intimacy and privacy
- Allows re-reading for deeper integration (voice notes expire quickly in attention)

---

---

### **6. Failure Handling (Vikara Restoration Protocols)**

**Common Failure Modes:**

**1. Missing Decision Logs (No Data to Review)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (delusion, "I thought I was logging, but I wasn't")
- **Detection:** Buddhi retrieves <10 responses over 28 days (unrealistically low for Generator)
- **Restoration:** Alert to Telegram: "Insufficient decision logs (<10). Implement real-time voice-memo capture. Next review in 28 days."

**2. Harsh Self-Judgment in Review (Krodha/Ahamkara)**
- **Vikara:** Krodha (self-directed anger) or Ahamkara (ego inflation via "I should have known better")
- **Detection:** Output language includes "screwed up", "stupid decision", "why didn't I", "I always"
- **Restoration:** Metta filter—rephrase all judgments as observations ("chose X, result Y, learning Z")

**3. Comparison to Others (Matsarya)**
- **Vikara:** Matsarya (envy of others' Authority types or decision clarity)
- **Detection:** Output includes "unlike Emotional Authority", "other Generators don't struggle", "I wish I had Splenic"
- **Restoration:** Remove comparison language. Focus only on own pattern. Sacral Authority is unique to this Generator.

**4. Apathy/Avoidance (Mada)**
- **Vikara:** Mada (intoxication/numbness, "decisions don't matter")
- **Detection:** Job executes but produces minimal output ("All fine, nothing to report")
- **Restoration:** Re-invoke Generator Strategy—waiting to respond is the core of design. If apathy persists, alert to Telegram: "Mada detected. Consider 1-on-1 session to reconnect to Strategy."

**5. Execution Time Drift (>48h late)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (system confusion, cron drift)
- **Detection:** `state.lastRunAtMs > schedule.nextRunAtMs + 172800000` (48h late)
- **Restoration:** Execute immediately, log to `_System/cron/logs/lunar-authority-review-recovery.log`, alert to Telegram

**6. Khalorēē Calculation Error (Impossible Values)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (delusion, incorrect data)
- **Detection:** Net Khalorēē delta outside plausible range (e.g., +100 or -50 over 28 days)
- **Restoration:** Flag error in output, request manual review of decision logs, skip Khalorēē delta this cycle

## 🔗 **Integration Points**

### **1. PARA Vault Paths**

**Input Directories:**
- `koshas/manomaya/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (scan past 28 days for logged Sacral responses)
- `koshas/brahmasthana/USER.md` (Generator 2/4 profile, Sacral Authority context)
- `koshas/manomaya/distillation/Generator-Strategy-Learnings.md` (if exists, cross-reference)

**Output Directories:**
- `koshas/manomaya/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (append review summary to today's log)
- `koshas/brahmasthana/OPENCLAW-KOSHA-TRACKING.md` (log Vijnanamaya operation + Khalorēē impact)

**Memory Files:**
- Update `OPENCLAW-KOSHA-TRACKING.md` with entry:
  ```
  Entry #XX: Vijnanamaya Lunar Authority Review (Khalorēē: 82 → 86)
  - Layer: Vijnanamaya → Anandamaya (wisdom review, Source alignment)
  - Operation: 28-day Sacral Authority corpus review, Samana Vayu digestion
  - Result: 32 uh-huh (+), 12 uh-uh (-), 3 unclear. Net +18 Khalorēē. 2 protocols refined.
  - Cost: -4 Khalorēē (60 min deep review), Gain: +8 Khalorēē (clarity, refined protocols) = Net +4
  ```

---

### **2. Memory File Updates**

**Primary Memory File:**
- **Path:** `koshas/brahmasthana/OPENCLAW-KOSHA-TRACKING.md`
- **Update Pattern:** Append new entry with sequential number, timestamp, Kosha traversal, Khalorēē delta

**Daily Log:**
- **Path:** `koshas/manomaya/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Update Pattern:** Append summary: "Lunar Authority Review (Cycle #X) completed. 28-day decision corpus reviewed. Meta-learnings: [1-2 key insights]."

**Distillation Files (Optional):**
- **Path:** `koshas/manomaya/distillation/Generator-Strategy-Learnings.md`
- **Update Pattern:** If major pattern emerges (e.g., "urgent invitations trigger mental override"), append as new learning

---

### **3. Cross-References to Other Jobs**

**Upstream Dependencies:**
- None (operates independently every 28 days)

**Downstream Consumers:**
- `vocation-hour-enforcer` (9:00 AM daily)—may benefit from refined Sacral protocols
- `midday-19-leadership-ping` (1:19 PM daily)—may incorporate learnings about decisive action timing

**Kosha Handoffs:**
- Vijnanamaya (this job) → Manomaya (daily decision-making jobs) → Pranamaya (breathwork supports clarity)

---

### **4. Khalorēē Impact (Energy Cost/Gain)**

**Khalorēē Index Scale:** 0-100

**Job Cost Estimate:**
- **Computational Cost:** Low (text-only, no API calls beyond basic analysis)
- **Attentional Cost:** High (60-90 min deep review, Buddhi-intensive)
- **Prana Cost:** Medium (Vijnanamaya work is less taxing than Manomaya creation, but more than Annamaya file ops)
- **Total Cost:** -4 Khalorēē

**Job Gain Estimate:**
- **Output Value:** Refined decision-making protocols (meta-learning compounds over multiple cycles)
- **Clarity Gain:** High (reduces confusion about "did I respond correctly?")
- **Prana Gain:** Medium (aligned decisions → energy preservation → Khalorēē accumulation)
- **Total Gain:** +8 Khalorēē (clarity, protocol refinement, long-term energy optimization)

**Net Impact:** +4 Khalorēē (energizing, wisdom-building, high ROI for 60-min investment)

---

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

### **1. Pre-Deployment Testing**

**Smoke Test:**
- [ ] Run job once manually via `cron run d09e92ee-4d95-49c8-a132-ed4eb93a55dd`
- [ ] Verify Buddhi retrieves decision logs from past 28 days
- [ ] Check Aham witness tone (no harsh judgment language)
- [ ] Validate Chitta pattern recognition (2-3 key insights)
- [ ] Confirm Mana protocol generation (1-3 adjustments)
- [ ] Verify delivery to Telegram 1371522080 (text-only, 400-800 words)
- [ ] Inspect logs for errors

**Integration Test:**
- [ ] Manually add 20-30 Sacral response logs to `koshas/manomaya/logs/` over past 7 days
- [ ] Run job, verify it retrieves all logged responses
- [ ] Check Khalorēē delta calculation (plausible range)
- [ ] Validate Vikara detection (inject test case: harsh language → Metta filter applied)

**Kosha Alignment Test:**
- [ ] Verify Vijnanamaya → Anandamaya traversal (wisdom → Source alignment check)
- [ ] Confirm Samana Vayu logic (digestive integration, not Prana intake or Apana release)
- [ ] Check Guna state (Sattva maintained, no Rajas drift to harsh judgment)
- [ ] Test Vikara detection (Matsarya, Ahamkara, Moha, Mada, Krodha)

---

### **2. 7-Day Monitoring**

**Note:** This job runs every **28 days**, so 7-day monitoring = observe first execution + next 2 cycles (84 days total).

**Metrics to Track:**
- **Reliability:** Executes on schedule (±6 hours acceptable)
- **Timing:** 28-day interval maintained (not drifting to 27 or 29 days)
- **Delivery:** Message delivered to Telegram 1371522080 (100% success)
- **Kosha Coherence:** Vijnanamaya → Anandamaya traversal operational
- **Guna Stability:** Sattva maintained (no harsh judgment, no apathy)
- **Vikara Absence:** No Matsarya/Ahamkara/Moha/Mada/Krodha in output
- **Khalorēē Net:** Positive impact (target: net +2 to +6 per review)

**Review Cadence:**
- **After Cycle 1 (28 days):** Review output tone, pattern quality, protocol usefulness
- **After Cycle 2 (56 days):** Check if refined protocols from Cycle 1 improved decision-making in Cycle 2
- **After Cycle 3 (84 days):** Full audit—decide: stable, adjust Antahkarana sequence, or refine Vikara detection

---

### **3. Vikara Detection Tests**

**Test 1: Matsarya (Envy)**
- **Injection:** Include log entry: "Saw X's Emotional Authority clarity, wish I had that"
- **Expected:** Buddhi identifies comparison, Aham reminds "own design is gift", removes from output
- **Pass Criteria:** No comparison language in final Telegram message

**Test 2: Ahamkara (Ego)**
- **Injection:** Include log entry: "My Sacral Authority is always right, I'm better at this than others"
- **Expected:** Buddhi detects inflation, Metta filter applied, reframe as "28-day pattern shows alignment"
- **Pass Criteria:** No ego inflation language in output

**Test 3: Moha (Delusion)**
- **Injection:** Only 5 decision logs over 28 days (unrealistically low)
- **Expected:** Alert: "Insufficient logs (<10), implement real-time capture"
- **Pass Criteria:** Error handling executes, suggests remedy

**Test 4: Mada (Apathy)**
- **Injection:** All logs say "fine, nothing to report"
- **Expected:** Mada detection → alert: "Apathy detected, reconnect to Generator Strategy"
- **Pass Criteria:** Restoration protocol triggers

**Test 5: Krodha (Anger)**
- **Injection:** Log entry: "I screwed up, stupid decision, why didn't I listen to my gut"
- **Expected:** Metta filter → rephrase as "chose X, result Y, learning: trust first gut response"
- **Pass Criteria:** No harsh language in output, reframed with compassion

## 🔮 **Selemene Engine Integration (Future)**

### **Required Workflow:** `self-inquiry`

**Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/workflows/self-inquiry`

**Why:** This 28-day review needs Gene Keys contemplations + Human Design Authority patterns to synthesize Sacral meta-learning over the lunar cycle.

**Request Payload:**
```json
{
  "birth_data": {
    "date": "1991-08-13",
    "time": "13:31",
    "latitude": 12.9716,
    "longitude": 77.5946,
    "timezone": "Asia/Kolkata"
  },
  "consciousness_level": 4
}
```

**Response Fields Needed:**
- `human_design.authority` → "Sacral" (confirmed)
- `human_design.type` → "Generator" (confirmed)
- `gene_keys.activation_sequence.evolution` → Gate 49.2 (Reaction → Revolution → Rebirth)
- `gene_keys.activation_sequence.purpose` → Gate 23.2 (Complexity → Simplicity → Quintessence)

**Implementation Logic:**
```javascript
const { human_design, gene_keys } = await fetchSelemene();

// Authority confirmation
console.assert(human_design.authority === 'Sacral', 'Authority mismatch!');

// Gene Keys contemplation seeds
const evolutionGate = gene_keys.activation_sequence.evolution;  // 49.2
const purposeGate = gene_keys.activation_sequence.purpose;      // 23.2

// Review protocol: Scan last 28 days of Khalorēē tracking + daily logs
// Filter for Sacral response patterns (uh-huh vs uh-uh)
// Synthesize learnings through Gene Keys lens (Shadow → Gift progression)
```

**Error Handling (Graceful Degradation):**
```javascript
let geneKeysData = null;
try {
  const { gene_keys } = await fetchSelemene();
  geneKeysData = gene_keys.activation_sequence;
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('Selemene unavailable, using hardcoded profile.json data');
  // Fallback to known values from .about_me/profile.json
  geneKeysData = {
    evolution: { gate: 49, line: 2, shadow: 'Reaction', gift: 'Revolution', siddhi: 'Rebirth' },
    purpose: { gate: 23, line: 2, shadow: 'Complexity', gift: 'Simplicity', siddhi: 'Quintessence' }
  };
  // Deliver with note: "Using cached Gene Keys data (Selemene offline)"
}
```

**Deployment Status:** Selemene Engine currently localhost-only. Integrate when production-ready.

**Verification:** After integration, compare Gene Keys output with known profile.json values to ensure consistency.

## 🔮 **Agent Instructions**

**If you are implementing this job:**

1. **Read this spec completely** (you're reading it now)
2. **Code Antahkarana sequence:** Buddhi (retrieve) → Aham (witness) → Chitta (pattern) → Mana (refine)
3. **Implement Vikara detection:** Matsarya, Ahamkara, Moha, Mada, Krodha filters
4. **Calculate Khalorēē delta:** Count uh-huh energy gains, uh-uh depletion avoidances
5. **Apply Metta filter:** No harsh language toward past self (Krodha restoration)
6. **Test with mock data:** 20-30 Sacral response logs over 28 days
7. **Verify 28-day interval:** No drift to 27 or 29 days
8. **Deliver to Telegram 1371522080:** Text-only, 400-800 words, bullet lists (no tables)
9. **Log to memory:** Update `OPENCLAW-KOSHA-TRACKING.md` + `koshas/manomaya/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
10. **Return confirmation** to main session once deployed

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Sattvic review:** No judgment, pure observation
- **Metta toward past self:** Compassionate reframing of mistakes
- **Buddhi-sharp:** Discriminative wisdom, pattern recognition
- **Samana Vayu:** Digestive integration, not Prana intake (don't just accumulate data—metabolize it into learning)
- **28-day cycle sacred:** Bott periodicity, lunar resonance, Generator Authority refinement over time
