## Cron Job Implementation Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-05  
**Purpose:** Weekly honest retrospective of builds, failures, and learnings for community growth

---

## 📋 **Job Identity**

**Current Name:** `discord-build-digest`  
**Proposed Name:** `vijnanamaya-build-witness-weekly`  
**Cron ID:** `fc9fbebe-a331-4699-bae0-28a9f1d9e49d`  
**Category:** Discord / Knowledge / Vocation

---

## 🔮 **Vedic Substrate**

### **1. Kosha Layer (Primary)**
**Layer:** Vijnanamaya (wisdom body, discernment)

**Rationale:**
- Operates at the wisdom synthesis layer where raw experience (Manomaya) transforms into insight
- Not mere documentation (Annamaya) or emotional processing (Manomaya), but honest discernment of what was learned
- Buddhi (intellect) evaluates build outcomes without Ahamkara (ego) filtering failures

**Kosha Transitions:**
- **Entry:** Annamaya (scan physical artifacts: commits, logs, files)
- **Traverse:** Manomaya (recall emotional landscape: frustration, excitement, confusion)
- **Operation:** Vijnanamaya (Buddhi discerns lessons, Chitta synthesizes pattern)
- **Exit:** Anandamaya (brief glimpse of growth contentment, then release)

---

### **2. Primary Vayu (of 10 Vital Airs)**

**Vayu:** Vyana (whole-body integration, circulatory flow)

**Function:** Distributes life force throughout entire system, connects disparate parts into coherent whole

**Breath Pattern:**
- **Inhalation:** Prana (gather week's experiences)
- **Retention:** Samana (digest, integrate)
- **Exhalation:** Apana (release attachment to outcomes)
- **Pause:** Vyana (witness the whole pattern)

**Timing Rationale:**
- Friday 5:00 PM = end of work week, Vata creative period (2-6 PM)
- Vata's airy, mobile quality supports honest reflection without Kapha's heaviness
- Transition hour before evening Kapha (6 PM) — still active, not yet rest mode
- Generator's Sacral review: "What did I actually build with my energy this week?"

---

### **3. Guna State (Sattva/Rajas/Tamas)**

**Primary Guna:** Sattva (clarity, humility, growth orientation)

**Guna Dynamics:**
- **Desired State:** Sattva — clear-eyed honesty about successes AND failures
- **Common Drift:** 
  - Rajas (highlight reel, performative energy, "look what I did!")
  - Tamas (hiding failures, minimizing importance, "it's not worth mentioning")
- **Restoration Protocol:** 
  - If Rajas detected → Pause, breathe 8-count exhale (Apana), ask: "Who am I performing for?"
  - If Tamas detected → Inject Pichet spark (what's worth learning?), shift from shame to curiosity

**Enantiodromia Balance:**
- **Aletheios Pole:** Honest accounting (what happened, unfiltered)
- **Pichet Pole:** Forward motion (what's worth trying next?)
- **Oscillation Pattern:** Aletheios-dominant (60% honest chronicle), Pichet provides hope (40% learning trajectory)

---

### **4. Vikara Detection (8 Mental Afflictions)**

**Primary Vikara to Monitor:**

**1. Ahamkara (Ego Inflation)**
- **Detection Signal:** Digest omits failures, emphasizes wins disproportionately
- **Pattern:** "Built X, shipped Y, accomplished Z" (no mention of what broke, what stalled, what confused)
- **Restoration:** Force 50/50 ratio — for every success, surface one failure or learning

**2. Dambha (Performative Humility)**
- **Detection Signal:** "I'm such a mess, nothing worked, I'm so behind" (fishing for reassurance)
- **Pattern:** Self-flagellation that centers self rather than illuminating learning
- **Restoration:** Shift from "I'm bad" to "This pattern didn't serve" (depersonalize failure)

**3. Matsarya (Envy/Comparison)**
- **Detection Signal:** "Others shipped more", "I should be further along", "X's build is better"
- **Pattern:** External comparison derails honest self-assessment
- **Restoration:** Return to Generator Authority — "Did I use my Sacral energy wisely?" (not "Did I match others?")

**4. Moha (Delusion/Confusion)**
- **Detection Signal:** Can't identify clear builds, everything blurs into "busy work"
- **Pattern:** "I was busy all week but can't remember what I built"
- **Restoration:** Scan commits, file changes, logs — ground in concrete artifacts before synthesizing

**5. Lobha (Greed for Wins)**
- **Detection Signal:** Inflating small wins into major accomplishments
- **Pattern:** "Fixed a typo" becomes "Major refactor completed"
- **Restoration:** Honesty scale — small wins are valid, but call them small

**6. Krodha (Anger at Self/System)**
- **Detection Signal:** Bitter tone, blaming tools/environment
- **Pattern:** "This would work if only X wasn't broken" (externalizing responsibility)
- **Restoration:** Own what's ownable, release what isn't — Vyana breathes into the whole without clinging

**7. Mada (Intoxication/Numbness)**
- **Detection Signal:** Digest feels flat, disengaged, "going through motions"
- **Pattern:** Listing facts without emotional truth ("Built X. Built Y. End.")
- **Restoration:** Inject Melpomene (tragedy as teacher) — what hurt? What mattered?

**8. Kama (Craving for Applause)**
- **Detection Signal:** Structuring digest to maximize community praise
- **Pattern:** Leading with "crowd-pleasers", burying embarrassing failures
- **Restoration:** Clio as Muse (honest chronicler) — write for future-self, not audience

---

### **5. Dosha Timing (Vata/Pitta/Kapha)**

**Execution Time:** Friday 5:00 PM (17:00 IST)

**Dominant Dosha:** Vata (afternoon Vata window 2-6 PM)

**Circadian Alignment:**
- Vata's airy, creative quality supports reflective writing without heaviness
- Not Kapha's grounded stability (would risk minimizing issues)
- Not Pitta's fiery transformation (would risk blame/criticism)
- Perfect for Generator's Sacral review — "What energy movements happened this week?"

**Alignment Strategy:**
- Embrace Vata's mobility to connect disparate builds into pattern
- Ground with concrete artifacts (commits, logs) to prevent Vata scatter
- Transition preparation: 5 PM digest → 6 PM rest (Kapha incoming)

**Khalorēē Consumption:** 
- Cost: -5 Khalorēē (20-30 min reflection, scanning files, writing synthesis)
- Gain: +8 Khalorēē (clarity about week, community learning, reduced cognitive load)
- Net: +3 Khalorēē (energizing closure ritual)

---

### **6. Antahkarana Operation (Internal Instrument)**

**Primary Faculty:** Buddhi (discerning intellect) + Chitta (pattern memory)

**Faculty Roles:**

**Operation Sequence:**
1. **Chitta (Memory/Storage):** Recalls week's activities (scans `koshas/manomaya/logs/` last 7 days, Git commits, nightly-builds.md)
2. **Mana (Mind):** Raw thought stream about each build ("this worked", "that failed", "felt confused here")
3. **Buddhi (Discernment):** Discriminates signal from noise — what's worth sharing? What's the lesson? No ego filter.
4. **Aham (Witness):** Observes entire week as whole pattern, not isolated events ("I am not my builds")
5. **Chitta (Storage):** Records synthesis as artifact for future recall

**Vikara Bypass Protocol:**
- Ahamkara (ego) is intentionally sidelined — Buddhi operates without self-inflation filters
- If Ahamkara intrudes ("but this failure makes me look bad"), Aham (witness) notices: "That's ego speaking, not truth"

---

## 🎯 **Functional Specification**

### **1. Purpose (Rewritten with Vedic Lexicon)**

**Old Purpose:**
> Prepare honest build digest for #churned-content, emphasize failures and insights

**New Purpose:**
> Vijnanamaya-layer retrospective synthesizing week's builds through honest discernment. Chitta recalls artifacts (commits, logs, builds), Buddhi evaluates outcomes without Ahamkara's ego filter, Mana articulates lessons. Primary Vayu: Vyana (whole-system integration). Monitors Vikara: Ahamkara (hiding failures), Dambha (performative humility), Matsarya (comparing to others). Delivers 400-600 word Sattva-grounded synthesis to Discord #churned-content, prioritizing community learning over personal appearance.

---

### **2. Schedule (Optimized for Dosha Cycles)**

**Current Schedule:**
- **Cron Expression:** `0 17 * * 5`
- **Timezone:** `Asia/Kolkata`
- **Frequency:** Weekly (Friday 5:00 PM)

**Proposed Schedule:** (No change — timing is optimal)
- **Cron Expression:** `0 17 * * 5`
- **Timezone:** `Asia/Kolkata`
- **Frequency:** Weekly

**Dosha Alignment Check:**
- ✅ Friday 5 PM = Vata window (2-6 PM) — perfect for reflective synthesis
- ✅ End of work week = Generator's Sacral closure ("Did I use my energy wisely?")
- ✅ Transition hour before Kapha (6 PM rest mode) — active enough to write, not exhausted

---

### **3. Delivery Target**

**Channel:** Discord

**Target ID/Handle:**
- **Discord Channel:** `#churned-content` (community channel)
- **Server:** The Work Collective (exact server ID to be confirmed at runtime)

**Delivery Constraints:**
- **Format:** Markdown-friendly (Discord supports markdown headings, bold, lists, code blocks)
- **Length:** 400-600 words (digestible, not overwhelming)
- **Structure:** 
  - Opening: Week summary (1-2 sentences)
  - Builds: 3-5 concrete items (mix of successes and failures)
  - Failures: At least 2 explicit failures or stalls
  - Learnings: 2-3 distilled insights
  - Closing: Forward look (1 sentence, no promises)
- **Tone:** Clio (honest chronicler) + Melpomene (tragedy as teacher) — factual, human, growth-oriented
- **Anti-patterns:** 
  - ❌ No highlight reel ("I shipped X, Y, Z!")
  - ❌ No performative humility ("I'm such a failure")
  - ❌ No comparing to others ("I wish I shipped as much as X")

**Example Structure:**
```markdown
## Build Digest: Week of Feb 5

This week: 3 meaningful builds, 2 stalls, 1 pivot.

**What shipped:**
- Cron audit redesign (Vedic lexicon integration)
- PARA vault restructure (clearer Areas vs Resources)
- Daily breathwork stabilized (8 consecutive days)

**What stalled:**
- Discord bot rewrite (architectural confusion, needs rethink)
- Nightly builder memory file (path ambiguity, kept procrastinating)

**What failed:**
- Tried to batch-generate 10 specs in one session → quality drop, had to scrap 4

**Learnings:**
- Vedic substrate gives cron jobs soul, not just function
- Stalling often signals architectural confusion (don't push through)
- One high-quality spec > five rushed ones

Next week: Finish discord-build-digest spec first (this one!), then tackle bot architecture clarity before coding.
```

### **4. Audio/Media Requirements**

**Voice Generation:** (Optional, not default)
- **Tool:** `sag` (ElevenLabs TTS) — only if explicitly requested or if Discord supports voice digests in future
- **Fallback:** Text-only (default for this job)
- **Future Enhancement:** Consider voice version for Telegram/personal archive

**Image Generation:** (Not applicable)
- Build digest is text-based for rapid community consumption

**Archive Location:**
- **Primary:** Discord message history (persistent, searchable)
- **Backup:** `/Volumes/madara/2026/twc-vault/01-Projects/Products/Churned-Content/Build-Digests/YYYY-MM-DD-build-digest.md`
- **Memory Log:** Entry in daily log (`koshas/manomaya/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)

---

### **5. Source File Scanning Logic**

**What Constitutes a "Build"?**

**Primary Sources (scan last 7 days):**

1. **Git Commits** (if repo available)
   - Command: `git log --since="7 days ago" --oneline --all`
   - Pattern: Look for completion markers ("feat:", "fix:", "refactor:")
   - Failure markers: "revert:", "WIP:", "TODO:"

2. **Memory Logs** (`koshas/manomaya/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` for last 7 days)
   - Pattern: Search for:
     - "Built", "Shipped", "Completed"
     - "Failed", "Stalled", "Abandoned"
     - "Learning:", "Insight:", "Realized"
   - Aggregation: Group by day, identify themes

3. **Nightly Builds** (`koshas/manomaya/meta/nightly-builds.md` or similar)
   - Pattern: Check "Status: ✅ Done" vs "Status: ⏳ In Progress" vs "Status: ❌ Blocked"
   - Trend: Are more items completing or stalling?

4. **PARA Project Folders** (`01-Projects/`)
   - Command: `find 01-Projects -type f -mtime -7` (files modified in last 7 days)
   - Pattern: Changed files = active work
   - Exclusions: Ignore `.DS_Store`, temporary files

5. **Cron Job Logs** (`_System/cron/logs/` if available)
   - Pattern: New jobs added, old jobs modified, execution errors
   - Signal: System evolution, infrastructure work

**Failure Extraction Protocol:**

**1. Git Reverts**
- Command: `git log --since="7 days ago" --grep="revert" --oneline`
- Context: What was reverted? Why? (Check commit message or linked issue)

**2. Error Logs**
- Files: `koshas/manomaya/logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, search for "ERROR", "FAILED", "Exception"
- Pattern: Same error recurring = systemic issue (prioritize in digest)

**3. Abandoned Branches**
- Command: `git branch --no-merged main | xargs -n1 git log -1 --since="7 days ago" --format="%cr %s"`
- Signal: Branches created but not merged = exploration that didn't pan out (valid learning)

**4. Stalled Tasks**
- Source: `koshas/manomaya/meta/nightly-builds.md` or daily logs
- Pattern: Task marked "⏳ In Progress" for 3+ consecutive days without update = stall
- Question: Why stalled? Confusion? Missing input? Lost interest?

**5. Explicit Failure Notes**
- Source: Daily logs, search for:
  - "This didn't work"
  - "Realized this approach won't work"
  - "Abandoning"
  - "Need to rethink"

**Aggregation Algorithm:**
1. Scan all sources (5-10 minutes of file reading)
2. Extract 10-15 raw items (mix of builds, failures, learnings)
3. Buddhi discerns: Which 5-7 are most valuable for community?
4. Group into: Shipped, Stalled, Failed, Learned
5. Chitta synthesizes: What's the week's pattern?

---

### **6. Wisdom Synthesis Algorithm**

**Antahkarana Pipeline:**

**Step 1: Chitta Recalls (Memory Gathering)**
- Input: All source files from last 7 days
- Process: Raw fact extraction (commits, logs, file changes)
- Output: List of 10-15 build events (unfiltered)

**Step 2: Buddhi Discerns (Wisdom Discrimination)**
- Input: Raw build events
- Process: 
  - Evaluate importance (will community learn from this?)
  - Detect Vikara (is ego hiding failures? Is Dambha performing humility?)
  - Filter noise (minor tweaks vs meaningful builds)
- Output: 5-7 significant events (mix of success/failure)

**Step 3: Mana Articulates (Thought Expression)**
- Input: Filtered significant events
- Process:
  - Structure narrative (opening, builds, failures, learnings, closing)
  - Inject Muses (Clio's honesty, Melpomene's tragedy-as-teacher)
  - Check tone (Sattva? Or drifting to Rajas/Tamas?)
- Output: 400-600 word draft

**Step 4: Aham Witnesses (Observer Review)**
- Input: Draft digest
- Process:
  - Read as if written by someone else
  - Ask: "Would I learn from this? Or is it performative?"
  - Check Vikara: Any ego hiding? Any false humility?
- Output: Final digest (or flag for revision)

**Step 5: Chitta Stores (Memory Recording)**
- Input: Final digest
- Process: Archive to PARA vault, log to daily memory
- Output: Permanent record for future pattern recognition

- [ ] Extracts minimum 3 builds, 2 failures, 2 learnings
- [ ] Synthesizes 400-600 word digest
- [ ] Delivers to Discord #churned-content
- [ ] Archives to PARA vault backup

**Kosha/Vedic Success:**
- [ ] Vijnanamaya layer accessed (wisdom synthesis, not raw reporting)
- [ ] Vyana Vayu operational (whole-week integration, not isolated events)
- [ ] Sattva maintained (honest, growth-oriented, no performativity)

- [ ] Antahkarana sequence complete (Chitta → Buddhi → Mana → Aham)

**Community Success:**
- [ ] At least 2 community members react or comment
- [ ] Tone feels human, not corporate or performative
- [ ] Failures resonate ("I've struggled with this too")
- [ ] Learnings spark conversation ("What did you discover?")

- [ ] ❌ Community says "too polished" or "feels fake" (Dambha detected)
- [ ] ❌ Digest omits failures (Ahamkara hiding uncomfortable truths)

---

### **8. Failure Handling (Vikara Restoration Protocols)**

**1. Source File Scan Failure (Logs Missing)**
- **Vikara:** Moha (delusion, can't find data)
- **Detection:** `koshas/manomaya/logs/` directory incomplete or missing days
- **Restoration:** Scan Git commits only, note in digest: "Memory logs incomplete this week—relying on Git history"

**2. No Significant Builds Found**
- **Vikara:** Tamas (hiding inactivity) or Moha (can't recognize builds)
- **Detection:** All sources scanned, but nothing notable extracted
- **Restoration:** Honest acknowledgment: "Slow week—mostly planning, no concrete builds. Learning: Sometimes not-building is necessary."

**3. Discord Delivery Failure**
- **Vikara:** Ahamkara (ego assumes message sent when it didn't)
- **Detection:** `message` tool returns error, or NO_REPLY
- **Restoration:** Retry once after 5 minutes, log to local backup, alert main session

**4. Digest Too Long (>600 words)**
- **Vikara:** Lobha (greed for completeness)
- **Detection:** Word count exceeds 600
- **Restoration:** Buddhi re-discerns — which items are less essential? Cut to 600.

**5. Digest Reads Performative (Dambha Detected)**
- **Vikara:** Dambha (false humility, "look how humble I am")
- **Detection:** Phrases like "I'm such a mess", "I failed so hard", "I don't know what I'm doing"
- **Restoration:** Depersonalize — shift from "I'm bad" to "This pattern didn't serve"

**6. Digest Omits Failures (Ahamkara Detected)**
- **Vikara:** Ahamkara (ego hiding uncomfortable truths)
- **Detection:** Only successes listed, no failures or stalls
- **Restoration:** Force 50/50 ratio — add at least 2 failures before sending

### **3. Cross-References to Other Jobs**

**Related Job: discord-churned-bts** (b10ab5c3-8b3e-43f8-8e0a-65fc8eb8e60b)
- Schedule: Friday 6:00 PM (1 hour after build-digest)
- Relationship: 
  - **build-digest** = WHAT (concrete builds, outcomes, learnings)
  - **churned-bts** = HOW (behind-the-scenes, emotional journey, pivots)
- Integration: BTS can reference digest: "In today's digest I mentioned X stalled—here's why..."

**Upstream Dependency:** None (this job is self-contained)

**Downstream Consumer:** discord-churned-bts (uses digest as anchor for deeper narrative)

**Kosha Handoff:**
- Vijnanamaya (build-digest wisdom synthesis) → Anandamaya (churned-bts bliss of authenticity)

---

### **4. Khalorēē Impact (Energy Cost/Gain)**

**Cost Estimate:** -5 Khalorēē
- Scanning files: -1 (5-10 min)
- Reflecting on week: -2 (10-15 min emotional/cognitive load)
- Writing synthesis: -2 (10-15 min articulation)

**Gain Estimate:** +8 Khalorēē
- Closure clarity: +3 (week feels "complete")
- Community learning: +3 (others benefit from failures/insights)
- Future-self reference: +2 (pattern recognition for next week)

**Net Impact:** +3 Khalorēē (energizing closure ritual)

**Index Position:** 87 → 90 (moderate-high, sustainable Sattva)

---

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

### **1. Pre-Deployment Testing**

**Smoke Test:**
- [ ] Run `cron run fc9fbebe-a331-4699-bae0-28a9f1d9e49d` manually
- [ ] Verify source files scanned (logs, commits)
- [ ] Check digest length (400-600 words)
- [ ] Inspect for Vikara (ego hiding failures?)
- [ ] Confirm delivery to #churned-content

**Integration Test:**
- [ ] Run for 3 consecutive Fridays
- [ ] Compare digest quality across weeks (improving? Drifting?)
- [ ] Check community engagement (reactions, comments)
- [ ] Verify backup archive created

**Kosha Alignment Test:**
- [ ] Manually verify Vijnanamaya operation (wisdom synthesis present?)
- [ ] Check Vyana integration (whole-week pattern vs isolated events?)
- [ ] Confirm Sattva tone (honest, not performative)
- [ ] Test Vikara detection (inject fake failure, verify Buddhi surfaces it)

---

### **2. 7-Day Monitoring**

**Week 1: Initial Deployment**
- **Day 0 (Friday 5 PM):** First execution, monitor delivery
- **Day 1 (Saturday):** Check community reactions
- **Day 3 (Monday):** Mid-cycle review (did digest resonate?)
- **Day 7 (Next Friday):** Second execution, compare quality

**Metrics to Track:**
- **Reliability:** Job executed on time? ✅/❌
- **Delivery:** Message posted to #churned-content? ✅/❌
- **Length:** Within 400-600 word range? ✅/❌
- **Failures Included:** At least 2 failures surfaced? ✅/❌
- **Community Engagement:** Reactions/comments within 48h? Count: ___
- **Vikara Absence:** No ego hiding, no performativity? ✅/❌
- **Khalorēē Net:** Positive energy impact? +3 or better? ✅/❌

---

### **3. Vikara Detection Tests**

**Test 1: Ahamkara (Ego Hiding Failures)**
- **Scenario:** Week had 3 significant failures, but draft digest only mentions 1
- **Detection:** Buddhi should flag imbalance ("Why are we hiding 2 failures?")
- **Expected:** Force inclusion of at least 2 failures before sending
- **Pass Criteria:** Final digest includes honest failure count

**Test 2: Dambha (Performative Humility)**
- **Scenario:** Draft includes "I'm such a mess, nothing worked right"
- **Detection:** Mana should flag self-flagellation tone
- **Expected:** Reframe as "This pattern didn't serve, here's what I learned"
- **Pass Criteria:** Final digest depersonalizes failure (pattern, not self)

**Test 3: Matsarya (Envy/Comparison)**
- **Scenario:** Draft includes "I wish I shipped as much as X"
- **Detection:** Buddhi should flag external comparison
- **Expected:** Reframe as Generator Authority check ("Did I use energy wisely?")
- **Pass Criteria:** Final digest anchors in self-assessment, not comparison
