# 🌙 Nightly Backlog

## 🟢 PHASE 1: THE DISTILLATION (Active: Feb 9 - Feb 16)
- [ ] **Entropy Reduction**: Archive the 200+ root-level files and "noisy" project subfolders identified by `vault_stats.py`.
- [ ] **Drift Zeroing**: Execute a full sweep with `witness-pulse.py` to canonicalize "Tryambakam Noesis" across the entire 112k-file field.
- [ ] **Samskara Pruning**: Identify and delete dead-end logic loops and "stale" todos from the last 30 days.

## High-Resonance Targets (Enantiodromia Architecture)
- [ ] **NotebookLM Aspect Ratio Skill**: A custom skill using `nano-pdf` to transform 16:9 NotebookLM assets into 9:16 mobile variants (intelligent recomposition, not just cropping).
- [ ] **The Signal Ingester Skill (Pichet)**: External Nadi Integration. A skill for Noesis Vishwakarma to scan curated X Lists (e.g., Scobleizer's) using `bird`, extract high-signal links, and archive them in `03-Resources/Technical/Tools/Intake/`.
- [ ] **The Pattern Synthesizer Skill**: A new skill for Chitta Weaver to automate the extraction of 'Lessons Learned' and 'Tatva' connections from large log files.
- [ ] **The Witness Pulse (Aletheios)**: Automated Entropy Scanner. A script that compares current file structure against `PANCHA-KOSHA.md` definitions to detect "naming drift" (e.g., 'WitnessOS' -> 'Tryambakam Noesis') or misplaced density.
- [ ] **The Novelty Injector (Pichet)**: Engine Cross-Linker. A tool that selects two of the 13 engines (e.g., Tarot + HRV) and generates a \"Bridge Synthesis\" prompt to catalyze a new micro-automation.
- [ ] **The Kosha Alignment Utility**: A CLI script (`kosha-check.py`) that prompts the user for Guna, Kosha, and Polarity coordinates, then outputs a diagnostic suggestion based on the Moolaprakriti Cube.

## Legacy Targets
- [ ] **MOC Integration**: Apply `moc_suggester.py` recommendations to core kernel files.
- [ ] **Exclusion Logic**: Update `vault_stats.py` to ignore `node_modules` and hidden files.
- [ ] **Breath Gating**: Design a CLI stub for the WitnessOS "Breath Interface."
- [ ] **E8 Visualization**: Port the `Architecture-Diagram-Creator` to visualize the 13-engine stack.
- [ ] **Security Audit**: Automated weekly `secret-scanner` run on all logs.
