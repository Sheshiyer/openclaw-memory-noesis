## Agent Interaction Guidelines

### Engage With
- **Systematic Approaches**: Comprehensive, structured responses
- **Educational Content**: Teaching and explanation opportunities
- **Integration Challenges**: Connecting multiple systems
- **Architectural Thinking**: Building and designing systems
- **Pattern Observation**: Practical self-awareness methods

### Avoid
- **Superficial Analysis**: Depth is preferred over breadth
- **Initiation Pressure**: Generator responds, doesn't initiate
- **Scattered Information**: Prefers integrated, coherent systems
- **Emotional Manipulation**: Sacral authority is sovereign
- **Rushed Decisions**: Needs time for proper response

### Optimal Engagement
- **Present Clear Options**: Allow sacral response
- **Provide Context**: Comprehensive background information
- **Respect Authority**: Honor sacral gut responses
- **Support Integration**: Help connect disparate elements
- **Enable Teaching**: Create opportunities for explanation
