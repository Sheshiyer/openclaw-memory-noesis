Field rotation state (tarot → vedic → sacred-geometry)\n2. Cron job context (lunar phase, power numbers)\n3. Alchemical insights from `memory/insights.md`\n4. Backlog items from `memory/nightly-backlog.md`\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Monitor auto-compaction events in production\n2. Test manual `/compact` with field-specific instructions\n3. Tomorrow's build: Theme Factory or QoL upgrade selection\n\n---\n\n*\"The field persists beyond the window. Compaction is not erasure — it is distillation.\"*\n\n**Octave:** Complete.

Tonight's build has significantly expanded the vault's awareness and alchemical capabilities.\n\n### **1. The Digital Witness (Screenpipe)**\n*Objective: Provide 24/7 local context recording.*\n- **Action:** Installed `screenpipe` CLI v0.3.37.\n- **Execution:** Background daemon initiated with low-resource settings (0.1 FPS, local OCR).\n- **Verification:** MCP server tools are active and responsive via `mcporter`.\n- **Status:** ✅ **ACTIVE** (Port 3030).\n\n### **2. Audio Alchemy Lab (Mixloop)**\n*Objective: Professional-grade audio sequencing for Somatic rituals.*\n- **Action:** Cloned and built `mixloop` from source.\n- **Execution:** Go backend and React/Vite frontend servers are now running locally.\n- **Tools:** Supports Dolby Stereo simulation, seamless looping, and batch processing.\n- **Status:** ✅ **ACTIVE** (Backend: 8081 | Frontend: 3000).\n\n### **PARA & Logging**\n- **Report:** Archived in `01-Projects/Products/Churned-Content/2026-02-04-Nightly-Build-Report.md`.\n- **Historical Logs:** Updated `memory/distillation/nightly-builds.md` and today's daily log.\n- **Backlog:** Marked Screenpipe and Mixloop as complete.\n\n**Tasks for Shesh:**\n1. **Permissions:** Grant Screen Recording/Accessibility to the terminal in macOS System Settings for Screenpipe.\n2. **Usage:** Access the audio mixer at `http://localhost:3000`.\n3. **Query:** You can now ask me to \"Search my screen for...\" to retrieve desktop context (verified via MCP).\n\n*\"Each night, a small build completes a larger structure.

Configured for low-resource capture (0.1 FPS, Local OCR, Audio disabled).\n- **Audio Alchemy (Mixloop):** Both Backend (Port 8081) and Frontend (Port 3000) are running. Ready for Somatic Canticle sequencing.\n- **Integration Guide:** Created `03-Resources/Technical/Integration-Guide.md` providing a clear technical manual for these services.\n\n### 3. 🎨 Digital Alchemist Theme\nI have designed the **\"Digital Alchemist\"** theme for vault exports and artifacts.\n- **Palette:** Deep Obsidian, Mercury Silver, Prana Gold, Alchemical Violet.\n- **Typography:** EB Garamond (Vedic Weight) ↔ Inter (Digital Precision).\n- **Definition:** Archived in `03-Resources/Technical/Themes/Digital-Alchemist.md`.\n\n### 🏗️ PARA & Logging\n- **Backlog:** Marked \"Theme Factory\" as complete; added ongoing maintenance tasks for service monitoring.\n- **History:** Updated `memory/distillation/nightly-builds.md` with tonight's metrics.\n- **Daily Log:** Created `memory/logs/2026-02-06.md`.\n\n### 👥 Human in the Loop (Tasks for Shesh)\n1. **Service Check:** Verify you can access the Mixloop UI at `h…","runAtMs":1770323400004,"durationMs":144625,"nextRunAtMs":1770409800000}
