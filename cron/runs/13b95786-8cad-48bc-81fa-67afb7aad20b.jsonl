Tech frames standards/stacks (IEEE 802.15.6, WBAN layers). Occult frames ritual/discipline as transformation tech. Same underlying pattern: *repeatable sequences that reliably shift state*.\n\n- **Type-based integration: knowledge → embodiment/action (Books ↔ Health ↔ Phassion/Tech)**  \n  Books explicitly calls out **5→8 integration** (stop hoarding, start building). Health mirrors it via **3→6** (stop optimizing as control, start listening/being). Phassion is the “action arena” where both must cash out.\n\n- **TWC as a cross-domain “mythic-systems commentary layer” (Technology ↔ Occult)**  \n  The Whole Critter transcripts appear in both, making a natural bridge: AI/transhumanism/noetic-theory show up as *technology critiques* and *esoteric cosmology* simultaneously.\n\n---\n\n## 2) [[wiki-links]] that should connect these domains\n\nHigh-leverage links to add (or strengthen) across the vault:\n\n- [[WHOLYDROPS-Protocol-Notes]] ↔ [[Phassion-Research-Hub]]  \n- [[TWC-Artificial-Intelligence]] ↔ [[Occult-Library-Index]] (egregore / autonomous complex lens)  \n- [[TWC-The-Transhumanist-Death-Cult]] ↔ [[Occult-Library-Index]] ↔ [[Technology-Library-Index]]  \n- [[Medicinal-Mushroom-Library]] ↔ (future) Phassion “bioelectric + immune/cognition protocol experiments” notes  \n- [[Enneagram-Growth-System]] ↔ [[Phassion-Research-Hub]] (use the integration-path framing to design sprints)\n\n---\n\n## 3) Health insights that apply to Phassion research\n\n- **Design Phassion like a health protocol, not a gadget.**  \n  Health library’s strength is *30–90 day protocols with measurable outcomes*. Translate that into: *baseline → intervention → tracking → iteration* as the core product loop (not “features”).\n\n- **Adherence is the real constraint.**  \n  Health shows the Type 3 trap: stacking protocols without embodiment.
